                "Applications related to security and privacy have made machine learning popular during the past 10 years. With the current volumes of so-called big data, manual processing is difficult and will be even more difficult in the future. To address this problem, machine learning has been implemented in a wide variety of technical <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> applications, particularly in big data processing and real-time decision-making applications to build quickly computed answers. A machine learning model is used to classify data with the greatest degree of accuracy. Machine learning techniques and algorithms come in a wide variety. The most recent study suggests that data-driven machine learning may be prone to security lapses, malware, and other problems. There are important privacy and information security issues that mobile systems and applications are addressing. This chapter explores the need for security and privacy in mobile technologies and demonstrates how crucial this issue is through technical improvements."

                "In this chapter, the authors go into the complicated world of using <em>computers</em> to create the shape of aerogels. They focus on SiC porous media and talk about other types of aerogel structures as well. Using Monte Carlo simulations with MATLAB and FORTRAN90, the study carefully looks at factors like pore size, medium thickness, and porosity to model SiC aerogels' porous structure correctly. By comparing the model's results to extinction coefficient data from the books, we can see that there is a strong link between pore size, porosity, and the extinction coefficient. Along with SiC aerogels, this chapter looks at other important factors that affect the shape of aerogels, such as the qualities of the source material, the sol-gel processing conditions, the drying methods, and the effects of temperature and pressure. Trends for the future show progress in <em>computer</em> modeling, the use of machine learning, possible breakthroughs in optimizing aerogel shape, and solving ongoing problems. Further study could look into new starting materials, creative ways to dry things out, and working with people from different fields, with a focus on finding long-lasting and repeatable production methods that can be used in real life. This thorough study combines results from experiments with mathematical accuracy, paving the way for a more complete understanding of aerogels and their uses in many <em>science</em> and economic fields."

                "Organizations are increasingly confronted with the need to modernize and reinvent themselves in order to keep up with the ever-evolving social and technological landscape. As a result, the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies is on the rise. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a scientific and technological field that has been utilized successfully in a variety of contexts for many years, and has since become an essential component of the leading technologies in organisational processes and within enterprises. The use of technology in human resource management has become a necessity for any HR department to be able to contribute to the growth of the organization. This book chapter aims to contribute to the understanding of the artificial technologies being implemented in HRM practices in the context of the digital era. Furthermore, offering an insight into the Usage of AI-based software in HRM, Opportunities, and Challenges in the digital world of work associated with AI in HRM. This chapter of the book will be of great importance to scholars and students of Human Resources Management, Knowledge Management, Organizational Innovation, <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>, and Information Systems. It will also provide guidance to HR professionals, organizations, and employees."

                "Cryptography is an important technique for protecting information and communications. It utilizes codes to ensure that only the intended recipients can access and understand the content. In the field of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, cryptography relies on mathematical concepts and algorithms are used to transform messages into an encrypted form. In our current era of increasing internet and information technology, securing data has become a vital concern. The cryptography algorithms are used to protect the data from unauthorized users, the machine learning algorithms are used to identify the common similarity between the huge data set. Both the ideologies differ from one to another, but in this chapter discusses the connection between the giant models in a newer way. The evolution of cryptography, from ancient times to modern technology, is explored in this chapter."

                "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> that works towards using machines/<em>computer</em> programs to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Some of these tasks may include prediction, problem-solving, reasoning, and inferring. Some the most notable uses are protein structure prediction (AlphaFold2) and the prediction of disease-causing genetic mutations in primates (PrimateAI-3D). Machine learning models have also found use in diagnosis. A study showed that it is possible to get accurate diagnosis from limited amounts of data if the data is handled and processed properly. Overall, AI can be applied in a wide range of fields, given that accurate and sufficient data is provided, and this is just what is known. There are many more applications that might come up over time. This chapter aims to give a basic overview of machine learning algorithms used to train models and shed some light on how it is being used in the fields of biotechnology and biomedical engineering."

                "The history of artificial intelligence is complicated. We cannot pinpoint where it all started. Some might say it began in the 1956 Dartmouth Conference when John McCarthy and his peers coined the term 'artificial intelligence' for the first time. The term 'robot' was coined in a Sci-Fi Play in 1920. We can find hints of similar ideas in ancient myths and scriptures, ideas about automata and intelligent creatures forged by men. AI is a vast and fascinating subject. The chapter presents an overview of the history of artificial intelligence. It also talks about the emergence and different sub-branches of AI and the theoretical foundation, frameworks, and theories related to them. After that its applications in the modern world and the challenges and Risks are also discussed."

                "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field in library <em>science</em>, involving the programming of <em>computers</em> to execute tasks that typically require human intelligence. The overarching goal is to create <em>computer</em> systems capable of thinking and acting like humans, which holds profound implications for the field of librarianship. AI has found widespread application within libraries, with examples including expert systems for reference assistance, robots designed to assist with tasks like book sorting, and the integration of virtual reality for immersive learning experiences. While some may fear that AI implementation could distance librarians from their users, the prevailing view suggests that it will instead complement human expertise rather than replace it. By leveraging AI, libraries can enhance their service delivery, streamline operations, and adapt to the evolving demands of a digital society."

                "This study examines the impact of technology on education, specifically focusing on motivation and learning principles for instructional enhancement. For 84 junior students from both <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and <em>computer</em> forensics, ARCS-based instruction showed improved motivation and academic performance. CS students experienced a 50% increase in success opportunities, while CF students had a 70% higher satisfaction rate with rewards. Statistical analysis confirmed the differences (p < 0.05), indicating tailored educational approaches; CS students adapt well; CF students prefer intrinsic reinforcement. However, academic achievement varied significantly, emphasizing the need for refined motivational strategies, particularly for CF students. The findings suggest that ARCS-based instruction benefits motivation and academic achievement, necessitating tailored approaches across subject areas. Integrating motivation <em>science</em> and technology can create captivating learning experiences that promote lifelong learning and academic success."

                "Recently, there has been widespread use of bio-inspired optimisation approaches to optimise solutions in domains including biology, mathematics, and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. In order to address the issues with traditional optimisation algorithms, bioinspired optimisation problems are typically nonlinear and constrained by multiple nonlinear constraints. Recent trends have tended to apply bio-inspired optimisation algorithms, which show promise for resolving challenging optimisation issue. In the realm of optimization and decision-making, there is a growing interest in harnessing the power of bio-inspired algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently and effectively. This chapter provides an overview of the research focused on the integration of genetic algorithms (GAs) with decision-making processes, drawing inspiration from biological evolution. A comprehensive framework for implementing artificial intelligence (AI) activities like learning, categorization, and optimisation is offered by the evolutionary algorithm known as the genetic algorithm (GA)."

                "This study explores neural architecture mapping (NAM) in human-swarm interaction (HSI), merging neuroscience, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, and robotics to enhance collaboration. It discusses NAM's concepts, challenges, and applications like neuroanatomy mapping, neural interface design, and algorithm development. Despite hurdles like neural complexity, NAM promises real-time monitoring, advanced brain-machine interfaces, and seamless HSI integration. The chapter offers an overview of NAM's aims, methods, and impacts on human-robot symbiosis and swarm systems. Theoretical neuroscience, human factor studies, and swarm robotics inform NAM, integrating neural networks with robotics for AI-driven swarm behavior. Adaptive learning in swarm robotics develops autonomous algorithms, enhancing collaboration. This research aims to improve swarm robotics' efficiency across various domains."

                "The AI voice assistant mobile application was developed to aid drivers in operating their mobile phones while driving without touching their phones. The literature review examines multiple innovative artificial technologies involved in applications with voice assistants in natural language processing (NLP) tech¬niques. The methodology used involved a qualitative approach, and the design <em>science</em> paradigm was used for the development of the voice assistant for smartphones with NLP techniques. NLP techniques that were applied in the development of the AI voice assistant are smart synthesis, data flow sequence, core and interface accessing, part of speech tagging, named entity recognition, conference resolution, and porter stemming. Some of the operations that are achieved by the application include arithmetic calculations based on voice commands and returning the <em>computer</em> result via voice, searching the internet based on user voice input, and providing a response via voice assistance."

The implementation of AI technology is progressively becoming more prevalent in sectors such as healthcare, banking, and transportation. The efficacy, accuracy, and decision-making capabilities of AI have the potential to revolutionize a wide array of industries. AI acquires knowledge and enhances its proficiency by utilising machine learning algorithms. These algorithms allow robots to assess extensive datasets, subsequently discovering patterns and insights that surpass human comprehension. Human-machine interaction centres on the collaboration between individuals and <em>computers</em> or machines, where it can anticipate assumptions and methods utilized to facilitate a spontaneous framework. The basic purpose of human-<em>computer</em> interaction (HCI) is to create functional systems that end users find useable, safe, and effective."

                "Advances in <em>science</em> and technology are making mechatronic systems more common in mechanical engineering. AI is involved in this transition. Artificial intelligence (AI) is <em>computer</em> software that makes decisions on its own. Simulating professionals' intelligent behaviour boosts efficiency and product quality. Artificial intelligencesystems have advanced since their creation. These systems are widely used in mechanical and industrial fields for image processing, intelligent perception, pattern recognition, and virtual reality. Automation and AI are common in industry and mechanics. This study examined AI in mechanical disciplines such heat transfer, production, design, and quality control. Research simulations show a variety of artificial intelligence systems that regulate mechanical manufacturing process components. ANNs, DCNN, CNN, fuzzy logic, and other AI are featured. Thus, new products and system development should be expedited. Mechanical engineering component rejections and faults may be eliminated using AI. Optimised systems can produce higher-quality, more expensive items."

                "Nature has all healing powers. Same way, nature is a basis of spur for resolving rigid and multifaceted problems Bio-inspired represents the parasol of diverse studies of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, mathematics, and biology in the last years. Bioinspired optmization algorithm is a developing approach that is based on the philosophies and motivation of the biological evolution of nature to develop new and robust challenging techniques. Biologically enthused computing and optimization is a foremost subclass of natural computation. This chapter presents a life-threatening survey of bio-inspired optimization techniques. Diabetic long-lasting disease upsets several organs of human body including the retina. Diabetic retinopathy datasets are taken and machine learning techniques are used to determine the detection of DR (diabetic retinopathy). Feature extraction and classification phases are involved, optimal results for composite problem are found, and correctness is predicted by using the GA."

                "The agricultural sector is undergoing frequent transformation and the inclusion of data analysis techniques have the potential to revolutionize the traditional farming practices. In recent years, use of data analysis methodologies with farming has become very important, as it can make farming more sustainable and efficient in the future. The main objective of this chapter is to explore and establish a comprehensive data analysis methodology for sustainable farming. The relationship between data-driven approaches and the advancement of commercially and environmentally sound and economically viable agricultural practices are explored. By combining <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and engineering with farming knowledge, this new method aims to change how farming can be done in an advanced way and wants to use resources better, grow more crops, and encourage sustainable farming."

                "Entering the 21st century, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and biological research have entered a stage of rapid development. With the rapid inflow of capital into the field of significant health research, a large number of scholars and investors have begun to focus on the impact of neural network <em>science</em> on biometrics, especially the study of biological interactions. With the rapid development of <em>computer</em> technology, scientists improve or perfect traditional experimental methods. This chapter aims to prove the reliability of the methodology and computing algorithms developed by Satyajit Mahapatra and Ivek Raj Gupta's project team. In this chapter, three datasets take the responsibility to testify the computing algorithms, and they are S. cerevisiae, H. pylori, and Human-B. Anthracis. Among these three sets of data, the S. cerevisiae is the core subset. The result shows 87%, 87.5%, and 89% accuracy and 87%, 86%, and 87% precision for these three data sets, respectively."

                "The internet and its proliferation have had a profound impact on various fields such as <em>science</em>, industry, and medical <em>computer</em> networks. This has resulted in improved medical treatments. Telemedicine serves as a connection between the fields of medicine and engineering, allowing the medical community to utilize engineering resources in order to enhance the well-being of the population. Smart surgery is a form of remote surgery where a surgeon operates on a patient from a distance. The surgeon operates remotely via communication tools, highlighting the intriguing potential of this technology. Telemedicine can be employed during surgery to establish communication with another specialist regarding the feasibility of the procedure. Televisions can serve as a means for postoperative monitoring, while robotic surgeons enable proficient medical professionals to do minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with remote-controlled surgical robots, delivering expert treatment from distant sites."

                "The use of <em>computers</em> in education has brought about developments in web technology, and Web 2.0 tools have begun to be used frequently in <em>science</em> lessons. Web 2.0 tools are a technology that allows materials to be developed without space and time limitations, and these materials can be easily shared with students. This study was prepared as a guide material on how to develop the lesson content of the eighth-grade <em>science</em> lesson on physical and chemical change using Web 2.0 tools. All contents about eighth grade physical and chemical change were prepared with Web 2.0 tools, and it was emphasized how to benefit from Web 2.0 tools. With Web 2.0 tools, various tools have been introduced for use in interactive presentations, animations, videos, concept maps, and measurement and evaluation. It is thought that lessons taught with Web 2.0 tools increase students' motivation, permanent learning occurs, and contribute to collaborative learning, and students will actively participate in the process."

                "Conceptual modeling has a long and chequered history that goes far back into the past. In <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>, it has been discussed since the 70s of the last century, when-after some preceding work on data and process abstractions-the fundamental paper by Peter P.-S. Chen appeared in which he introduced the Entity-Relationship Model. In honor of the 65th birthday of Ulrich Frank who throughout his career has been deeply and also critically engaged with conceptual modeling, we present in this paper a few observations and thoughts on this history."

Three requirements concerning structure, objects, and behavior that each modeling technique for <em>computer</em>-integrated systems must fulfill are identified and formulated as postulates. Corresponding modeling concepts are identified and epistemologically motivated. Furthermore, they are integrated into a comprehensive infrastructure for all basic tasks necessary to model <em>computer</em>-integrated systems."

                "Ulrich and I shared an office for five years at GMD's Cologne Research Center on the Information Economy (1987-1992),1which laid the foundation for a lifelong friendship. We both had studied management at the University of Cologne (1978-1983) at a time when seminar theses and punch cards for the COBOL course as part of the IS specialization were written with. We compiled collections of index cards for referencing and abstracting literature and collected folders with copied articles and books. A notorious examination question in the oral IS exam was 'how many punch cards fit into this room?'. The historic reflections are obviously subjective and stylized, yet they try to capture the changing sentiments over the past decades as well as persistent issues like the role and ethos of <em>science</em> that are revisited and rearticulated over time. The disciplinary focus is on management, IS and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, other disciplines have different research and publication cultures. I use Elsevier as an example to illustrate the impact and risks of digitalization of academic publishing house, or 'information analytics businesses' as Elsevier has rebranded itself."

                "At the end of the 1950s, the possibility of machine learning in <em>computers</em> began to be discussed. After more than half a century, thanks to technological advances, machine learning is more than a reality; it is a tool that supports different fields, such as education, business, <em>science</em>, and management. This chapter explores how machine learning takes place in decision-making, especially in the managerial field, and the advantages that it offers when studying scenarios, choosing strategies, exploring the possible consequences of our actions, and/or predicting the likely responses of the parties involved in a specific situation."

                "CFD is not merely a computational tool; it is an indispensable asset with versatile applications, particularly in the biomedical field. Its role in understanding complex physiological systems and guiding decision-making in medical design and interventions through advanced simulations cannot be overstated. Whether in drug delivery systems, physiological flow analysis, surgical planning, or medical device development, CFD emerges as a rapidly developing and essential tool in biomedical research. Despite biomedical applications engage with the nuances of human physiology and internal fluid actions, the accession of high-performance hardware and software together with discoveries in <em>computer</em> <em>sciences</em> have rendered recent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications in the biomedical field more accessible and viable. The review paints a comprehensive picture of CFD's journey from a specialized area of mathematics to a transformative force in healthcare."

                "Building <em>computer</em> devices and systems that can demonstrate learning, reasoning, and decision-making skills similar to those often associated with human intelligence is the focus of the field of artificial intelligence. It also includes working with data sets larger than what the human mind can process. A variety of academic disciplines, including <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, data analytics, statistics, hardware and software engineering, languages, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology, are all included in the interdisciplinary area of artificial intelligence. The development of artificial intelligence is increasingly taking centre stage in many countries' governmental agendas. Policymakers are primarily concerned with the application of artificial intelligence to social welfare, legal framework creation, economic consequences, implications for global security, and equity issues, among other things. Artificial intelligence has been the main driver of recent large and rapid breakthroughs in the technological area."

                "AI plays a significant role in education in general and very definitely in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> education. AI offers various benefits, but there are also well-grounded concerns and potential dangers present when AI is used in education. It is therefore essential that a proper investigation and analysis of the need for improved regulation for the use of AI in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> education is conducted. An ethic of care coupled with ethical guidelines for the use of AI in education should be the minimum requirement, but an approach that enhances human rights in the use of AI in education, might be the safest and most effective approach to ensure that the use of AI does not infringe about the human rights of all stakeholders."

                "As the need for skilled <em>computer</em> programmers increases each year globally, so does the need for learning environments that serve the novice programmer. This literature review aims to contribute to the field of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> education by highlighting successful practices reported in the literature and describing those practices through the lens of instructional design. As the demand for programmers increases, the success of novice programmers remains stagnant. By reviewing research-based instructional practices through the lens of instructional design, instructional designers, researchers, and CS, instructors can make purposeful design decisions in the future that help to meet the needs of the growing number of novice programmers. This chapter highlights the importance of instructional design theories and learning methods in meeting the diverse needs of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> learners."

Against the background of navigating <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> education in the 21st century, the chapter will discuss e.g., self-directed learning, game-and problem-based learning, as well as blended and online teaching and learning. One of the objectives of the study centers on developing a framework around the fully online learning community model and different types of learning."

                "Despite social, historical, and cultural diversity, as well as poor educational attainment amongst high school learners, South African higher education is undergoing a digital revolution that fosters the cultivation of self-directed learning. This chapter contends that self-directed learning should not solely prioritize the accomplishment of tasks and the instructor's oversight of task completion. Instead, it should be centered around empowering learners to critically examine established conventions. Studies have demonstrated that learners from underserved regions are at a disadvantage when they enroll in higher education because they lack digital technology skills, which limits their level of critical thinking in problem-solving. The chapter further seeks to assist teachers and education policy makers in South Africa to keep up with the new pedagogical approaches that are suitable for 21st century learners and should enhance self-directed learning."

                "In recent years, higher education has witnessed a shift towards open education and the proliferation of educational resources. Open educational resources (OERs) have gained prominence for their potential to revolutionize education by allowing students to create freely available, adaptable, and customizable content. Simultaneously, traditional assessment methods have come under scrutiny for their limited ability to measure critical thinking and practical skills. <em>Computer</em> <em>science</em> education, with its emphasis on innovation, is well-suited to embrace these changes. This chapter introduces creating OER as renewable assessment activities as an innovative approach, contributing to the discourse on open education, assessment, and pedagogy in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, emphasizing student empowerment, mastery, and intrinsic motivation."

                "To prepare students for the challenges of the Fifth Industrial Revolution, it is essential to cultivate deeper self-directed learning (DSDL) in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> education. The process of DSDL empowers students to take ownership of their learning, enabling them to transfer their knowledge and skills to unfamiliar contexts. The proposed DSDL framework is anchored in cognitive load theory and social constructivism and draws upon three core concepts: the organization of course content; teaching and learning methods rooted in cooperative learning; and the characteristics of tasks. The importance of structuring course content to offer an initial holistic overview of key concepts, followed by deeper cycles of revisiting and reinforcing these concepts is underscored. Teaching and learning methods, such as cooperative pair programming and cooperative pair problem solving, are recommended. Moreover, the framework advocates for the adoption of a whole-task approach, involving authentic, complex tasks that encourage students to grapple with challenges and to learn from their failures."

                "The introduction of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> education (CSE) in schools is required to prepare the learners for future work and develop the required 21st century skills. However, for competent and confident learners, the educators need to be upskilled and trained to develop CSE teaching capacity and skills. The use of robotics education (RE) provides a more concrete (less abstract) environment for the introduction of CSE. Although CSE is introduced at schools, concern relates to the required access to quality training, required equipment and support from gatekeepers that delay or hinder the advancement of CSE. The good practices for the informal option of CE at higher education institutions (HEI), through engagement with and within a community of practice (COP), to provide access to quality CSE training and skills development to educators, visionary community leaders and learners is presented in terms of the balanced scorecard (BSC) perspectives of strategy, process, people, resources and growth and sustainability."

                "Regardless of the imperatives of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education to meet learning outcomes, little is known about its integration in dialogic learning outcomes in the post-COVID 19 era. From the learning <em>sciences</em> perspective, this chapter explores faculty members' adoption of AI resources for dialogic pedagogy using a participatory research design and social-constructivism theory. Interview data was obtained from 6 faculty members of two of Ghana's teacher education universities. Manual coding in Microsoft Excel yielded themes from the participants' narrative data with voices embedded. The results suggest that generic <em>computer</em> training, social media and internet exposure, data analytics, multimedia capacity, and digital pedagogy are the leading skills required for AI integration for dialogic learning goals among faculty members. In conclusion, capacity building for faculty to effectively deploy AI resources in students' dialogic learning goals requires learning scientists' effort and inputs."

                "Computational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving method that depicts on thoughts and procedures from <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> to implements complex problems in an organised and effective manner. It encompasses collapsing down problems into subproblems, convenient components, recognizing patterns and perceptions, and originating algorithms to resolve them. Applying CT to learning can definitely help enhance students' ability to think significantly. The present study highlights the importance of computational thinking and its implication on student's ability to think. The segment of computational thinking is a kind of problem-solving skill that adopts the process of a <em>computer's</em> systematic manner. In response to this, <em>computers</em> are involved with deriving conclusions and solutions that are equipped with decomposing an issue, using analytical information and others. On the same hand, the application of computational thinking is deemed of high quality in inducing higher thinking capacities among students and strengthening their cognitive process which in turn brings forward advancing solutions."

The motivation behind the use of synthetic data stems from data privacy concerns, limitations in data availability, and the necessity for diverse, representative datasets. This chapter delves into various synthetic data generation methods, such as statistical modeling, generative adversarial networks (GANs), simulation-based techniques, and data envelopment analysis (DEA). It also scrutinizes the evaluation metrics for assessing synthetic data quality and privacy preservation. The chapter highlights applications in healthcare, finance, social <em>sciences</em>, and <em>computer</em> vision, and discusses emerging trends, including deep learning integration and domain adaptation. Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers will gain valuable insights into the state-of-the-art in synthetic data generation."

                "Citizen <em>science</em> has contributed to the development of knowledge in the environmental <em>sciences</em>, particularly concerning the ecological study of biodiversity. Citizen participation is voluntary and expresses the values and desires of participants to engage in the preservation of nature. <em>Computer</em>-aided identification applications use new information technologies and artificial intelligence for fast, efficient recognition of organisms from photographs, sounds or videos. This chapter provides a presentation and analysis of interviews and testimonials on the use of Pl@ntNet to acquire, share and mobilize botanical knowledge for conservation purposes. It discusses the strengths and limitations of the current tool, and outlines the prospects for improvement in the context of the expected growth and evolution of citizen <em>science</em>. The chapter presents the major challenges posed by the use of the Pl@ntNet application and possible future developments, both technical and in terms of uses and our relationship with nature."

                "In the current age of contemporary medicine, the healthcare sector has advanced significantly thanks to artificial intelligence (Al) and data <em>science</em>, as well as sophisticated devices and high-end <em>computers</em>. In today’s technological environment, machine learning (ML) has evolved as an interdisciplinary tool. It was deliberately used in this project effort because of its incredible capacity to detect and reduce nonlinearity. ML develops itself via training. ML is currently trained in three fundamental ways: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. The following are the most significant algorithms used in supervised learning: linear regression; logistic regression; SVM; naive Bayes; decision trees; K-nearest neighbor. Unsupervised learning is further divided into two parts: clustering and association. Reinforcement learning approaches include: Monte Carlo; Q-learning; and deep Q network. ML has been used to detect and predict Covid-19 instances. Moving on to additional applications of machine learning, it has been proven to be useful with environmental challenges."

                "The rapid resurgence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized nearly every field of <em>science</em> and technology. The ubiquity of smartphones and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms has led to an expectation that most smart applications will run on the edge of cellular networks. This has increased the focus on the introduction of the digital edge to support AI-friendly applications on specific cutting-edge platforms. Thus, a new research field named “edge computing” has been developed, covering two areas, and revolutionizing them: wireless networking and computing. The restricted computing capacity and minimal data for the unit are resolved by an essential topic of advanced learning. This is accomplished by the usage of the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) interface and the utilization of the vast volume of data spread over a wide range of edge <em>computers</em>. Distributed knowledge processing and connectivity between the edge server and devices are two significant, connected elements of these networks, and their convergence presents a range of new study challenges. This article introduces a new set of ideas known as learning-driven wireless networking in advanced computing and provides examples of the feasibility of these concepts and specific research tools."

                "Artificial intelligence plays a major role in every field nowadays. It is a part of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> in which machines can act like humans in terms of behaviour, thinking and decision-making. It has a tremendous impact in all sectors. In short, it replicates human intelligence. The main aim of artificial intelligence is to mimic the human brain through reasoning, learning and problem-solving. Artificial intelligence is achieved by machine learning concepts. It includes supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, labelled data will be given for processing so that the machine can learn it easily and it either categorizes or recognize the given task. Whereas, in unsupervised algorithms, without knowing any details about the data, learning will be done automatically by using some clustering concepts. The semi-supervised algorithm will be the combination of both supervised and unsupervised algorithms. Reinforcement learning will be the most useful one in case of real environments like playing games, driving a car and playing a piano. In this case, a machine will learn on its own by getting the rewards and penalties. Additionally, ensemble algorithms like Bagging, Boosting and Stacking are also available to learn the machines. In recent years, the role of these algorithms has been marvellous in the field of remote sensing. In this chapter, a view of both machine learning and deep learning with satellite imagery for remote sensing data is given."

                "Researchers in <em>computer</em> vision are developing a method for Action Quality Assessment (AQA) that evaluates the quality of human actions in videos rather than identifying them. Specifically for figure skating, the task involves estimating the final scores from a video of a short program. It serves as an auxiliary assessment for judging skaters’ performances. Despite the significance of accurately predicting individual jump scores due to their substantial impact on final scores, prior studies have overlooked this aspect. Although videos concentrate on a solitary skater, they often include extraneous elements unrelated to assessing the quality. Consequently, expert humans discard non-essential data to make visually precise evaluations. Our research has illuminated the gaze patterns of judges and skaters when assessing jumps, developing a jump-performance prediction model that leverages their gaze patterns to filter out irrelevant information. In addition, we enhanced its predictive precision by incorporating kinematic data from a tracking system. The findings revealed a marked contrast in gaze patterns: skaters focused mainly on the face, while judges paid more attention to the lower body. Integrating these gaze patterns into our model improved its learning efficiency, with the model improved accuracy by assimilating the gaze data from both groups of specialists. Our work marks an innovative step towards merging human insight and artificial intelligence to tackle the challenge of jump performance evaluation in figure skating, offering valuable contributions to <em>computer</em> vision and sports <em>science</em>."

                "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to massive destruction of the economy and the amount of losses is estimated at more than 700 billion dollars. Increased demand in the construction and building structures market due to the restoration of Ukraine requires an increase in the production of sandwich panels. TPK-Center LLC specializes in the production of products for industrial and commercial construction, such as sandwich panels and metal products. Changes in the external environment of the company’s operations, the structure of demand for sandwich panels with different insulation materials require changes in its marketing strategy in terms of product mix. Based on the analysis of the business portfolio, such strategic decisions as “BUILD”, “HOLD”, harvesting and elimination strategies are proposed. A study of the company’s customers was conducted and a conclusion was made on the marketing strategy of business relations and the formation of a quality customer experience. The main ideas for improving the marketing strategy are the development of digital marketing, the creation of a specific marketplace for product sales and the involvement of a complex of online promotion of the enterprise in the market. To develop the digital direction and online sales, there is a need to improve the marketing department at the enterprise, which should also include specialists in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, economics, and advertising technologies. A marketing strategy for the export of sandwich panels was also proposed. Today, there is high competition in Ukraine, so Western markets, considering the high quality of sandwich panels and the possibility of obtaining European certificates, are quite attractive."

                "Writing assessment is a ubiquitous component of education, job seeking and promotion, everyday communication, and more. To serve these crucial activities, automated writing evaluation (AWE) technologies have been developed to facilitate and streamline assessment and feedback by providing faster, more consistent, and ostensibly less biased judgments than human evaluators. This chapter synthesizes insights from <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, sociolinguistics, social psychology, and ethics to (a) highlight the potential for bias inherent to the building and implementation of AWE along with barriers to resolving those issues, and (b) discuss research on bias mitigation strategies. This chapter is intended to propel future research toward more equitable development and use of AWE."

                "The development of precise virtual entities of human bodies has been pursued for many years, but to date, there have been few positive reports. In recent years, the success of digital twin (DT) technology in industrial applications has led to greater interest in establishing human body DT models. In particular, many recent advances in materials <em>science</em>, electrical engineering, and <em>computer</em> engineering have exhibited the intrinsic power of DT models in the detection and processing of complex body signals, indicating that the goals of establishing human body DTs are getting “within reach.” In this article, we discuss current DT technologies in industry, and then review advanced electronics and artificial intelligent algorithms, which are must-have building blocks for human DTs. Finally, perspectives on the use of human body DTs in improving the quality of life and introduction of never-have immersive virtual-reality experiences are discussed."

                "Presently, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education holds substantial importance within higher education institutions worldwide. This research compiles and examines 51 ICT programs and 1,251 associated ICT courses from 11 universities in China’s Shanxi province. The micro-level analysis aims to disclose insights about the macro-level scenario, delving into the course design of ICT education in China and potentially on a global scale. This case study discovers that the most sought-after ICT programs primarily center around Information and Computing <em>Science</em>, as well as <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> and Technology. Mathematic and Programming-related courses lay the foundation for ICT programs, while Programming is the most frequently offered course in ICT programs at Shanxi universities. Through the data analysis, a suggestion is made to include courses in the context of Cloud Computing and Cybersecurity for the ICT programs offered by Shanxi universities."

                "Artificial Intelligence (AI), in the present time, is a widely utilized technology that is being implemented practically in every sector’s activity and it is a widely discussed topic in the research field the reason for its infinite uses. AI is nothing more than a discipline that applies <em>computer</em> <em>sciences</em> to massive datasets to enable decision-making and problem-solving. Furthermore, it comprises the components of AI known as deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), which are normally referred to simultaneously. As the need of the hour, almost every industry is involved in adopting new technologies to improve their operational efficiency in the current technologically sophisticated period, and the finance sector is not exempted from this change. For making stock market predictions, a variety of models, both conventional and technological, are developed. However, in more recent times, all studies have been carried out utilizing various models that may be broadly separated into two categories: DL and ML approaches. It appears that DL and ML share similar principles. However, it is crucial to recognize how the two of them differ from one another. They both fall under the category of AI. While ML is defined as a subclass of AI, DL is regarded as a subsection of ML. The objective of this book chapter is to compare and contrast the ML method with the DL strategy in order to identify their main distinctions. Understanding a method’s benefits, drawbacks, and applicability is crucial before adopting it. The study will be useful in providing information on the use of both strategies and their unique advantages for users."

It is used in several applications related to <em>computer</em> networks and their security. One of the main goals of AI is to allow machines to work automatically, intelligently and with minimal human intervention. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that works great for a wide variety of problems. It is used to solve problems with the aim of producing better results than existing traditional techniques. However, it encounters limitations due to the increase in data. This motivated researcher to find an effective alternative called Deep Learning (DL) which gives more accurate results in the presence of massive amounts of data. In this article, we are interested in the field of AI, more specifically DL, to design a biometric system capable of guaranteeing Automatic Facial Recognition to detect and authenticate an individual in real time. Common facial authentication methods involve extracting facial features to compare them to images stored in a database to find a suitable match."

                "When “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) employs techniques like sentiment analysis and “Natural Language Processing,” it demonstrates potential usefulness in a variety of contexts. In the business realm, AI enables machines to self-learn through the evaluation of information and the acquisition of new information which they can subsequently apply to a variety of activities. AI is a broader concept that encompasses the <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> subfields of machine learning and deep learning. Radiography and the treatment of chronic illnesses like malignancy are two areas where AI has been used to great effect. It's clear that AI has significant advantages over traditional approaches to research and treatment options that rely solely on human intervention. When AI methods are given the opportunity to learn from training instances, efficiency increases, allowing for insights into therapeutic variance, patient care, examinations, and results that were earlier impossible to obtain. Another area where AI has created a noticeable influence is medicine. This ground-breaking innovation, previously thought impossible, is now completely within reach. This constantly developing technology is now an integral part of our lives in ways we could never have predicted. The widespread implementation of AI in medicine has caused a tsunami in the information technology sector. An assortment of healthcare-related AI applications and techniques are discussed in this chapter."

                "Global trends related to the development of modern countries and organizations include the dissemination of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). It is emphasized that these systems operate on the border of the digital and physical worlds and offer wide opportunities in many strategic areas. CPSs have the potential to be used in autonomous vehicles, medical systems, and many safety-critical technologies. One of the features of CPSs is the increasing complexity that determines the need to ensure cybersecurity. With the development of this environment, new challenges, vulnerabilities, and threats appear. CPSs are exposed to many threats that may disrupt their functioning and violate information security attributes. Therefore, an essential element for the further development of CPSs is ensuring security and minimizing the risk of threats. This objective can be achieved through appropriate risk management and the implementation of measures to prevent or reduce the effects of threats. The chapter aims to develop a risk management framework to ensure the cybersecurity of CPSs. We analyzed and synthesized the literature in security <em>science</em>, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, and management <em>science</em> to review existing approaches to risk management. In addition, this chapter highlights typical threats and vulnerabilities as well as risk minimization mechanisms. Research findings indicate that ensuring the cybersecurity of CPSs requires a holistic approach to risk management. Moreover, the challenges in the organization’s environment determine the need for continuous improvement of the cybersecurity management system for CPSs."

                "Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a well-studied area of <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> and a strong candidate for a theoretical backbone for a wide variety of AI systems, which require solving the problems of scheduling, enumeration of choice and even pathfinding. DAGs are usually taught within the curriculum of graduate-level and advanced undergraduate-level Graph Theory classes and can sometimes end up ignored by a lot of students due to the threatening appearance of the wider study of graphs. This chapter will summarise a semi-informal description of what DAGs are and present algorithmic solutions to standard graph problems but reframed and formulated to the framework of DAGs. It will also go over some conceptual AI systems that run on top of DAG-like frameworks."

                "Health is wealth, and maintaining good health is essential to humanity’s survival. The evolution of the healthcare sector parallels the progression of humanity through time. Today, with the rapid advancement of <em>science</em> and technology in the medical field generally, numerous innovations in the healthcare sector have been made, including applications for remote medical diagnosis and treatment, pandemic forecasting, and remote patient health monitoring. The idea of the Internet of Things emerged with the introduction of fifth generation communication networks in the early 2020s. The sixth generation of communication networks, or 6G, which is anticipated to debut in 2030 will be the next IoT revolution and contain autonomous IoT systems as well as a number of endogenous intelligent applications that benefit humanity. Smart healthcare is one of the areas that gets the most attention. In this study, we suggest an all-in-one <em>computer</em> architecture for real-time Internet of Health Things (IoHT) applications and outline potential ways to implement the architecture. Finally, we talk about problems, unresolved concerns, and potential future study possibilities. We anticipate that the findings of this study will be crucial guides for future investigations into human health."

                "A potent method for resolving challenging optimization issues is provided by metaheuristic algorithms, which are heuristic optimization approaches. They provide an effective technique to explore huge solution spaces and identify close to ideal or optimal solutions. They are iterative and often inspired by natural or social processes. This study provides comprehensive information on metaheuristic algorithms and the many areas in which they are used. Heuristic optimization algorithms are well-known for their success in handling challenging optimization issues. They are a potent tool for problem-solving. Twenty well-known metaheuristic algorithms, such as the tabu search, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and harmony search, are included in the article. The article extensively explores the applications of these algorithms in diverse domains such as engineering, finance, logistics, and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. It underscores particular instances where metaheuristic algorithms have found utility, such as optimizing structural design, controlling dynamic systems, enhancing manufacturing processes, managing supply chains, and addressing problems in artificial intelligence, data mining, and software engineering. The paper provides a thorough insight into the versatile deployment of metaheuristic algorithms across different sectors, highlighting their capacity to tackle complex optimization problems across a wide range of real-world scenarios."

                "In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the integration of technology and evolving student dynamics have ushered in a new era of teaching and learning (TnL). This article explores the transformative power of gamification in online education, shedding light on its capacity to ignite motivation, enhance engagement, and facilitate meaningful learning experiences. Traditional education paradigms have expanded, requiring educators to guide students in exploring knowledge and essential skills in digital environments. Gamification emerges as a potent solution in this context, seamlessly blending educational content with gaming elements, creating stimulating and rewarding learning journeys. Gamification, rooted in the fusion of game design principles and non-game contexts, has risen to prominence. It has been recognized for its potential to revolutionize engagement and behaviour transformation, with over 70% of Fortune Global 2000 organizations adopting it by 2014. This article explores the burgeoning realm of gamification, its rapid evolution, and its role as an innovation catalyst in the teaching and learning landscape. A study conducted with 30 <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> students at the National Defence University of Malaysia reveals the impact of gamification on student engagement. Results indicate that the gamified approach effectively encourages active participation in online discussions and engages students’ passion for learning. These findings underscore gamification's potential to create dynamic and interactive learning environments, aligning with its growing popularity and transformative potential. As the digital generation shapes education, gamification offers an innovative approach to fostering effective learning experiences that cater to evolving preferences. Gamification represents a revolutionary method bridging education and gaming, promoting motivation, active involvement, and improved learning outcomes. This study prepares the way for a new era of enhanced and interactive learning experiences, equipping educators to harness the potential of gamification and adapt education to the evolving needs of contemporary learners."

                "Domain adaptation is the concept of improving the performance of a model on a target domain, by leveraging the knowledge gained from the source domain. Speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is the ability of a machine or a system or a program to identify words spoken by a person and convert them into readable text. In this chapter, a novel concept called the domain adaptation was used on the welltrained, self-supervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for the low-resource target domain data. Research in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, linguistics, and <em>computer</em> engineering are all used in speech recognition. Speech recognition features are built into a lot of contemporary gadgets and text-focused software to facilitate easier or hands-free usage. Automatic speech recognition is the process of using <em>computer</em> algorithms to convert spoken language into written text. Some of the challenging tasks are being able to recognize speech in noisy environments, the accent difference since it changes from one person to another, and the availability of the dataset to train the model. These models perform well on data which are the same type of data or same data used to train the model but its performance decreases when it encounters a new type of data, so to leverage the concept of domain adaptation on the self-supervised ASR models has been proposed. The domain adaptation was used and tested on the (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) NPTEL sample dataset and a real time dataset acquired through lecture recording."

                "Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has successfully invaded all the dimensions of pharmacology. This core branch of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> has created many new and unique ways for advancement in diagnosis, medicines, and health care. Although this technology is recognized many years ago, over a few years it has shown spectacular advancement in diagnostic, predictive, and therapeutic purposes in practically all fields of ailments and diseases. This chapter is an updated discussion on the implication of artificial intelligence in the discipline of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Globally, it is a widely known cause of illness and death. HCC management remains a challenge. AI models which analyze and assimilate large datasets are used for the detection of HCC. The interpretation of histology images is not easy because images change with the course of the ailment, so AI is used to analyze the vast amount of data. AI divisions such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) help in interpretation and decision-making. The application of AI can help interconnect various data variables to predict survival chances after HCC treatment. AI has shown a superior way to characterize or differentiate benign tumors, malignant tumors, and HCC. ML and DL are increasingly employed in the recognition, characterization, and prediction of HCC. With help of AI future guidelines for HCC treatment and management can be shaped."

                "Blockchain is an innovative and emerging technology that enables the structuring of open data in a secure and decentralized manner. This technology is a driver of digital transformation that permeates all sectors of the economy. In this context, many companies concerned with environmental governance principles are adopting blockchain in their sustainability practices. Thus, the following problem arises: How can the blockchain technology assist in environmental sustainability? To answer this question, the following objective was outlined: to map in the light of a bibliometric review how blockchain technology can assist in environmental sustainability. To this end, a bibliometric search was conducted in the Web of <em>Science</em> database. The results showed that research stands out in the following areas of knowledge: Ecology Environmental <em>Sciences</em>, Other <em>Science</em> Technology Topics, <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>, Engineering, Business Economics, Operations Research Management <em>Science</em>, Telecommunications, Energy Fuels, Food <em>Science</em> Technology, Information <em>Science</em> and Librarianship. It was also found that one of the uses of blockchain technology can assist in environmental sustainability and tracking of substandard products to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."

                "This chapter presents the results of a preliminary investigation conducted to determine which learning styles are most suited to the study of Form 2 <em>Science</em> in a Personalized Learning Environment. (PLE). Another issue is that even students in the same classroom setting may not be the same. They may be at various phases in their educational journey or have different preferred methods of instruction. Because students are so frequently overlooked during the implementation of new technology, this project will focus on their viewpoint. Learners today are bringing ever-more-advanced gadgetry into classrooms, and higher education institutions throughout the globe are gradually integrating <em>computers</em> into their toolkit of pedagogical resources. Students have shown a need for supplementary <em>Science</em> materials to supplement their current course load. It considers how students are utilizing them, how that may vary from the recommended practice indicated in the literature, and what that may mean for the use of technological devices in the classroom."

                "Numerous current research trends are dedicated to harnessing the inherent attributes of quantum physics, particularly superposition and entanglement, for various computational applications. Unfortunately, the current state of quantum devices underscores the pressing need for increasing stability and noise immunity in the actual quantum devices. Today, quantum computing applications, such as quantum metaheuristics, use a hybrid scheme because of the problems above. In general, metaheuristic algorithms have found extensive use within <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> for addressing optimization challenges that are inherently intractable using conventional methods. Unfortunately, certain problems can demand extensive time to arrive at a solution, spanning from days to years. Quantum computing presents a promising avenue for tackling such problems, as it offers the potential to exponentially reduce solution times by leveraging its inherent quantum parallelism and other quantum phenomena. The proposed approach integrates MATLAB, a quantum genetic algorithm, quantum simulators, and access to quantum devices via Amazon Braket. The methodology is exemplified through the implementation of a basic genetic algorithm. Furthermore, experimental findings underscore that the quantum genetic algorithm yields comparable results and achieves them with fewer generations. This underscores the efficiency of the quantum genetic algorithm methodology when contrasted with its classical counterpart. Unfortunately, there still exist significant latency times between classical computing and the quantum device."

                "Earth observation with advanced, large-scale technologies as satellite piloted Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) appear essential to monitor agricultural ecosystems in near future. Radar backscatter e.g. allows insights to crop conditions, soil properties and direct mapping of vegetation growth. Precise SAR pre-processing is a substantial prerequisite to perform machine learning on SAR data, e.g. for early prediction of optimal sowing, harvesting and fertilization time points. Not only for a successful, resource-efficient and environmentally friendly farming but for a wide range of other fields concerning environmental observations. Open access technologies offer the best solutions for collaborative efforts, thus minimizing financial and legal constraints in comparison to technologies residing in the commercial sector. Here, we combine expertise from the area of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, data <em>science</em>, software engineering, agriculture and geo-information-systems to build on state-of-the-art, open source (OS) tools and technologies in Germany. Our goal is to provide an easy to employ Sentinel-1 SAR pre-processing tool as well as a Germany wide, open access, pre-processed, analysis-ready database of Sentinel-1 SAR data. With the employment of modern software developing methods including the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture and a procedural and object-oriented design, these solutions can be extended, adapted and tested. This solution is available and accessible here (Jennifer, JenniferMcCl/Sentinel-1_SAR-Data-Processing: Sentinel-1_SAR-Data-Processing_V.1.0-beta, https://zenodo.org/record/8214935)."

                "The integration of ChatGPT into Art and Design education represents a transformative shift in teaching methodologies and student learning experiences. This chapter provides an in-depth analysis of ChatGPT's role in customizing educational experiences to individual students’ needs in creative disciplines, fostering personal expression and innovation. The AI's adaptive capabilities not only streamline portfolio reviews by offering objective feedback on design principles and narrative consistency but also empower educators to focus more on mentoring and less on administrative tasks. Moreover, the technology acts as a catalyst for creativity by providing a plethora of inspiration and interactive opportunities for students to transcend conventional boundaries, thus nurturing groundbreaking artistic expressions. The establishment of a “Virtual Art Library” and the facilitation of cross-disciplinary dialogues exemplify ChatGPT's role in promoting continual engagement with educational content and fostering integrative learning that bridges art with other domains, such as environmental <em>sciences</em>. ChatGPT's accessibility transcends financial, geographical, and linguistic barriers, making quality education more inclusive. It extends its utility beyond the classroom, offering alumni continuous career guidance and creative support, ensuring lifelong learning and professional development. The chapter underscores the balanced integration of AI with traditional pedagogy to redefine educational paradigms, enhancing the inclusivity, dynamism, and personalization of the learning environment. Ethical considerations are also addressed, emphasizing the importance of maintaining authenticity and originality in the creative process. The chapter advocates for the responsible use of AI to complement rather than replace critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, it calls for strict data privacy and security measures to protect intellectual property and foster trust. In summary, this chapter encapsulates the potential of ChatGPT to revolutionize Art and Design education, from enhancing individual learning journeys and supporting alumni to nurturing a holistic, ethical, and inclusive educational ecosystem."

                "Research on the impact of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) on mothers and teachers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is limited, marking a unique intersection of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and psychology. This study explores whether SNSs facilitate communication between teachers, mothers, and ASD children for teaching social and daily life activities, and the impact of these interactions. IoT technology is introduced as a pivotal enhancement in this context. A model, reflecting participants’ preferences and experiences, includes four aspects: (1) Online ASD community engagement, enhanced by IoT-enabled secure and tailored communication platforms. (2) Diverse SNSs and technology preferences, with IoT providing adaptive interfaces for varied user needs. (3) The reduced stigma from ASD awareness, augmented by IoT’s data analytics for personalized support. (4) Positive effects of SNSs on ASD children’s social, behavioral, and academic development, further improved by IoT’s real-time monitoring and interaction capabilities. Questionnaires for 54 mothers and 52 teachers revealed that IoT-enhanced SNSs positively impact ASD community engagement, stigma reduction, and child development. This model suggests integrating IoT-enriched SNSs for rehabilitation and therapeutic purposes in ASD support environments and homes, offering effective and low-cost treatment options."

                "Offensive language can lead to uncomfortable situations, psychological harm, and, in particular cases, even violence. Social networks and websites struggle to reduce the prevalence of these messages by using an automated detector. One goal of Human-<em>computer</em> interaction (HCI) <em>sciences</em> is to provide respectful, safe, and user-friendly systems. This extends to any form of <em>computer</em>-mediated social interaction. This chapter contributes to this objective by proposing a Romanian language dataset for offensive message detection. We manually annotated 4,052 comments on a Romanian local news website into one of the following classes: non-offensive, targeted insults, racist, homophobic, and sexist. In addition, we establish a baseline of five automated classifiers, out of which the model based on RoBERT and two layers of CNN achieves the highest performance with a weighted F1-score of 74.74%."

                "New learning approaches and strategies are crucial to be employed to produce students with twenty-first-century skills such as real-life problems solving, creative educational models, and Artificial Intelligence in education to enable them to face new global challenges. Thus, this study employed Fermi Problem-based Learning with Artificial Intelligence (FPBL-AI) model to develop twenty-first century skills in teaching <em>Science</em> (Creative thinking, Critical thinking, Communication skills, and Collaboration skills) among the Cycle Three students in the United Arab Emirates. It also examined the effectiveness of this strategy between male and female students. This study used quasi-experiment design. The instrument for research was pre and post-test using twenty-first century Skills which was prepared by the researchers. The participants purposively selected according to a certain criterion, then divided for the experimental group, consisting of 25 grade ninth students, from Ramah Primary and Secondary School, they were taught <em>Science</em> units using the Fermi Problem-Solving with artificial intelligence model for 6-weeks, Whereas the control group consisted of 25 grade ninth students who were taught the same units using traditional methods. The data were analysed using the t-test to determine the effectiveness of the strategy on developing their twenty-first century skills and to determine the variation in the effectiveness of the strategy between male and female students. The findings revealed the effectiveness of the Fermi problem-based learning with Artificial Intelligence model in developing the twenty-first century skills in teaching <em>Science</em> among the United Arab Emirates Cycle Three students. The findings also demonstrated that there were no significant differences in the effectiveness of the strategy amongst male and female students. Thus, Fermi Problem-Based learning with Artificial Intelligence model is considered an effective approach in teaching <em>Science</em> during provide an interactive learning environment and in improving students’ twenty-first century skills especially creative and critical thinking skills, communication and collaboration skills, and problem-solving skills. In addition, the positive results of this model can help teachers to integrate Fermi Problem-Solving with Artificial Intelligence into their teaching practice in order to achieve the objectives of teaching <em>science</em> in the twenty-first century."

                "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged in recent times, advancing research in marine <em>science</em> at an unprecedented rate. Oceanographic forecasting, marine species monitoring, coral reef assessment, and AI-enabled marine robotics are a few of the applications this powerful tool has come in handy for marine scientists. This paper aims to demonstrate various examples of AI applications in marine <em>science</em>. <em>Computer</em> vision, for instance, can be used in marine species monitoring, as well as automated identification and classification. Machine learning algorithms can monitor marine mammal populations by tracking behavioral patterns and so much more. Even these two examples, <em>computer</em> vision and machine learning, provide immense insight to help scientists understand how to better research and conserve ocean life. AI algorithms can analyze underwater images to assess coral reef health and classify coral species. Thus, AI provides scientists with important information regarding reef biodiversity. Also, AI can predict, with integrated environmental data, certain coral stressors such as sea surface temperature, currents, dissolved oxygen, and harmful algae. Robotics powered by AI has paved the way for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which can identify species and collect data while a scientist sends instructions to the robot. Through these applications, AI offers advances in marine <em>science</em> and oceanography like such that have never been seen before. While AI has demonstrated immense potential in marine <em>science</em>, it also faces certain limitations, which are also discussed in the chapter."

                "New-age research in <em>science</em> including biological <em>sciences</em> will be driven as well as challenged by a flood of biological data that needs proper handling in order to be able to harness the advantage of data in research. In fact, research in biological <em>sciences</em> including genetics has become more data-intensive, with a higher throughput of studies, cases, and assays, in order to derive meaningful insights from studying small components of a larger system. Greater data give better insights into the biological phenomenon and need appropriate support from allied disciplines such as mathematics, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, physics, and bioinformatics. However, any such integration of these will be driven largely by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) providing complex algorithms for processing biological data. The disciplines of genetics, genomics, and other allied <em>sciences</em> have provided theoretical foundations of plant breeding for developing crop varieties. The unprecedented challenges of food security, climate change, sustainability, and safeguarding ecosystem services have necessitated appropriate technologies including climate-resilient varieties that add sustainability to intensive agriculture. Since the progress of plant breeding in recent times has largely been driven by genomics, molecular markers, as well as other multi-omics technologies, it is imperative to create institutional mechanisms for mainstreaming the effective use of AI and AI in genetics, genomics, and crop breeding platforms. Crop genetics and breeding as a <em>science</em> has progressed beyond imagination, from the Mendelian ratios to more of a predictive analysis that has touched every aspect of human existence such as the origin and evolution of life, evolutionary trends, plant and human health, as well as understanding the genomic basis of biological diversity and synteny relationships (structural, functional, and comparative genomics) to precise manipulation of genes (gene editing). The phenomenal growth and outstanding discoveries in genetics and crop breeding have witnessed huge data and information that need toolkits for interpretation using statistical techniques, AI/ML algorithms and data mining to examine historical data and to precisely forecast upcoming events. This chapter throws light on the basics of these aspects as applied to genetics and plant breeding."

                "It is no news that the realm of artificial intelligence has penetrated effectively into every other realm of <em>science</em> and technology and many other discrete fields. The term artificial intelligence, as the name suggests, is the intelligence, normally and expectedly associated with living beings, particularly the human species, to be remastered into an alternate intelligence of sorts, and delegated to <em>computers</em> and/or robots. The penetration of AI in the postmodern world can be fathomed by the fact that its applications are found even in the same fundamentals from which it has eventually evolved, which is the “technology” sphere itself. To this assertion, the employment of recent robotic customer support chat can be found in every tech world or web portals. AI is redefining the health system globally today and is saving lives and improving their quality as well. This chapter provides a brief introduction to the various applications of AI in healthcare."

                "The need to implement the state policy of the country’s transition to an innovative path of development implies significant changes in the system of higher education. To date, potential employers and educational institutions have come to a consensus that the modern labor market needs highly qualified specialists of a new formation, ready for any challenges that arise in front of them in an increasingly competitive environment. There is a serious problem of inconsistency of interests of production, universities and graduates of higher educational institutions regarding employment and career growth. There is a gap between the needs of production in the relevant competencies of university graduates and the offer of competencies that the university forms in accordance with the state educational standard. Therefore, this article discusses the solution of the resulting problems with the use of elements of a dual learning system with the definition of continuity between the university and the school in the specialty of <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>."

                "Machine Learning is a subdivision of <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> and Artificial Intelligence which deals use of algorithms and data to mimic the way human brain works and later improving the accuracy. Machine learning is a field of examination to understand and build algorithms that 'learn' that is it can pull up data to increase quality of performance on some set tasks. It’s a part of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning is a vital part of the upcoming field of data <em>science</em>. Even though using algorithms and quantitative methods are tuned to make predictions or classifications, data mining projects. These methods make drive decision doing within application and businesses. Machine learning, neural networks, deep learning are all sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning (ML) is type of artificial intelligence that allows applications to become more precise at predicting outputs without being programmed. ML uses previous data as input to predict new outputs. Recommending with previous searches are mainly the common use of machine learning. Other main uses are spam filtering, malware threat alert, fraud detection, malware threat alert, predictive maintenance, BPA. Machine Learning is principal because it gives firms a view of trends in business operational patterns and user behaviour, also encourages in development of new products. Leading companies like Google, Uber, and Facebook makes machine learning an important part of their companies. Machine learning become a supreme selling proposition for many companies."

                "Finance has been combined with technology to introduce newer advances and facilities in the domain. One such technological advance is cryptocurrency which works on the Blockchain technology. This has proved to be a new topic of research for <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. However, these currencies are volatile in nature and their forecasting can be really challenging as there are dozens of cryptocurrencies in use all around the world. This chapter uses the time series-based forecasting model for the prediction of the future price of Ethereum since it handles both logistic growth and piece-wise linearity of data. This model is independent as it does not depend on past or historical data which contain seasonality. This model is suitable for real use cases after seasonal fitting using Naïve model, time series analysis, and Facebook Prophet Module (FBProphet). FBProphet Model achieves better accuracy as compared to other models. This chapter aims at drawing a better statistical model with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the basis of several trends from year 2016 to 2020. Analysis carried out in the chapter can help in understanding various trends related to Ethereum price prediction."

                "This paper brings information about activities and information security methods and techniques that are used in the education of software engineers at Subotica Tech—College of Applied <em>Sciences</em> in Serbia. The objective of this paper is to outline the information security domains covered in the curriculum of Subotica Tech—College of Applied <em>Sciences</em>. These domains are integrated into various undergraduate and postgraduate courses offered by Subotica Tech. The education system incorporates innovative techniques, such as hackathon-based learning and collaborative team projects, to introduce new approaches and methodologies. The second chapter briefly describes the ISSES project that was crucial for developing a master’s program in information security. Information about B.Sc. and M.Sc. study programs at Subotica Tech is presented. Competition in information security which was conducted within the ISSES project is described. The following section provides information on a new approach in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> education, HBL (Hackathon Based Learning). The main characteristics of HBL are outlined, along with the hackathon process itself, and examples from both academia and industry are presented. The next chapter offers details on the testing and implementation of methods to prevent threats defined in the OWASP Top 10 document. These methods and techniques are mandatory for students during creating their projects."

                "This article discusses the potential of quantum <em>computers</em> to revolutionize many areas of <em>science</em> and technology, including cryptography. While traditional IT security relies on encryption algorithms to safeguard data and authentication processes, quantum <em>computers</em> pose a threat to this security by their ability to perform mathematical operations much faster than classical <em>computers</em>, potentially breaking encryption algorithms such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Brute-force attacks and cryptanalytic attacks are two main approaches for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a system or network, but quantum <em>computers</em> may increase their efficacy to a level that poses a significant risk to IT security. The article also highlights the need for quantum-resistant encryption algorithms to address these potential security threats and discusses blockchain as a potential alternative approach to increasing security of IT systems."

                "<em>Science</em>, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are central to any educational system. The term started with the National <em>Science</em> Foundation as “SMET” and was changed to STEM at a later date due to phonetic reasons. The term was not widely used until Virginia Tech University began offering a “STEM education” degree in 2005 (Friedman 2005). The term STEM covers a broad spectrum of different disciplines. While, in general, STEM is used as an umbrella term for the natural <em>sciences</em>, engineering, mathematics, and technology-related fields, there are some variations in its usage. For example, the US National <em>Science</em> Foundation (NSF) characterizes STEM as including chemistry, <em>computers</em> and information technology, engineering, geoscience, life <em>sciences</em>, mathematical <em>sciences</em>, physics and astronomy, psychology, social <em>sciences</em>, educational research, and STEM education (Gonzalez and Kuezi 2012). Whereas this approach considers the social <em>sciences</em> to be of central importance to STEM and the STEM workforce (Spalter-Roth 2004), in the United Kingdom, STEM is seen to include fields such as medicine, dentistry, and architecture but exclude the social <em>sciences</em> and education (United Kingdom, House of Lords, <em>Science</em>, and Technology, Committee 2012)."

                "During fall 2018 and fall 2019, we designed a highly interactive 4-class period ethics and teamwork minimodule and embedded it in an upper-level design course in Electrical & <em>Computer</em> Engineering at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). In the first two class periods, we covered ethical principles, moral theories, and the pillars of morality: honesty, fairness, and reciprocity. In class, students watched segments of video lectures by Harvard’s Michael Sandel and Emory University’s Frans De Waal. Small group discussions followed the video lectures. Student teams led teamwork demonstrations via in-class games during the last two class periods. Strong student engagement was observed. Previously, in the fall of 2016 and spring of 2017, we instigated prosocial software design and development in the UAB <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> capstone course, which requires a team project. Three out of seven student teams developed prosocial app concepts. Additionally, from 2019 to 2021 we led the UAB Ethics in Action: Art or App Design Challenge, which encourages college students nationwide to develop prosocial app concepts or artworks for class projects. In the fall of 2021, students at three different institutions submitted award-winning entries. We urge faculty leadership to encourage a prosocial approach to software design. Research on developing moral reasoning algorithms is needed. The authors’ interdisciplinary research on detecting cyberbullying and nastiness in social media and their history of collaboration in university outreach projects and <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> and Engineering education and research are also described."

                "The immune system of an organism responds to threats from outside the body. Autoimmunity in immunology is the system of an organism's immune responses against its healthy cells, tissues, and other typical body parts. Therefore, a disorder known as an autoimmune illness results from an inappropriate immune reaction to a healthy bodily function. The <em>science</em> of developing <em>computers</em> with intelligence that both mimics and exceeds that of humans is known as artificial intelligence (AI). Programs having AI capabilities can contextualize and analyze data to deliver information or automatically initiate operations without the need for human intervention. Furthermore, AI can be attained through machine learning. This branch of AI applies to learning to make ever-better judgments using algorithms to discover patterns and acquire insights from data automatically. In this chapter, we present the role of AI and machine learning to analyze how autoimmunity behaves in conditions like autoimmune diseases. Moreover, we also discussed the impact of employing machine learning techniques to optimize precision medicine for patients."

                "The chapter of the monograph contains a study of digital financial assets (DFA). The authors consider these digital assets as a certain segment of digital rights. It is argued that digital rights are attributed by the Russian legislator to one of the heterogeneity of rights to property, which, in turn, belong to the more general category of “property”. Russian legislator as a way of certifying certain rights also considers DFA, in addition to their understanding as a certain segment of objects of civil rights-requirements (OCR). Authors explore a dual understanding of the category of “DFA” at a specific time of the advancement of Russian legislation. Building a digital economy in modern Russia is impossible without deep <em>computer</em> algorithmization of procedures for interaction between financial market participants, including its Internet investment segment. According to the authors, within a period of up to 10 years, there will be a total replacement of all documentary and non-documentary securities with digital analogues. In addition, during this period there will be a final transition to a remote Internet format for conducting transactions with all securities and other financial instruments. Authors do not suggest abandoning the investment technology of DFA. Since this technology is significantly more variable compared to any securities, if only because a whole package of different securities may appear inside one DFA, both by their issuers and by types of securities themselves, hybrid options and their combinations are possible: DFA+ utilitarian digital rights. Authors concluded that the legal nature of DFA is determined by an innovative way of fixing the fact of ownership and the volume of obligations and corporate rights known to civil law to participants in civil turnover. Digital technologies of a distributed registry and the functioning of information systems in which counterparties interact remotely carry out the fixation. The understanding of the category of “DFA” as special objects of civil law, previously unknown to civil <em>science</em>, is controversial."

                "Achieving the optimal state is one of the most fundamental issues in the universe. Due to the limited resources accessible to humans, optimization has become a vital matter and its application range is increasing day by day. Mathematics, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, civil engineering, industries, mechanics, and economics discuss only a part of these important applications (Kaveh in Advances in meta-heuristic algorithms for optimal design of structures, 2021). In this type of critical issues, the goal is to obtain the best decision state among several different states. Today, meta-heuristic algorithms can be considered one of the most important methods for solving optimization problems. In order to optimize structural skeletons that include non-linear and non-convex modes and are often associated with several local optima, meta-heuristic algorithms face problems that cause stagnation in the optimization process. One of the most important of them is premature convergence and falling into the trap of local optima."

                "In the context of the AI age, the integration and innovation of cloud computing, data <em>science</em>, and other advanced technologies in higher education have resulted in the creation of smart learning. It offers a good chance to completely implement an adaptive and individualized learning system. This paper is AI-driven and student-centered, it begins with the specific needs of learning and examines the natural language processing-based human–<em>computer</em> interaction technologies and the design of Personalized Learning Assistant (PLA) systems. This can collect and analyze massive volumes of educational data, and analyze quantitative information on learning status, learning behavior characteristics, and learning impacts which can aid in developing a comprehensive personalized learning model. This can also smartly build tailored study plans and learning programs, propose learning materials and implement an adaptive customized learning system based on learning impact feedback. This research explains the concept of digital tutoring and the proposed framework of the PLA system."

                "With <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> becoming a compulsory area of curriculum across the world, experts agree on the importance of developing understanding of computational thinking from a young age. Research on augmented reality in education is also gaining momentum and has demonstrated many benefits including positive effects on students’ learning outcomes and motivation. ByteEd’s Play Code Learn series of <em>science</em>, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) kits utilise a new approach of teaching <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> with an unplugged-to-digital methodology alongside innovative augmented reality technologies. A study has been conducted to examine the impact of the first Play Code Learn kit—Dinosaur Steps—in New Zealand classrooms. The unplugged approach has proven to be advantageous to learners and highlights a significant shift in knowledge retention and understanding of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> concepts, skills, and literacy after engaging with the kit. Moreover, the use of play-based methodology increased motivation for learning."

This chapter investigates how CV combats problems brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic by introducing new strategies and boosting the performance of existing techniques. Numerous deep learning techniques are used including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and deep belief networks (DBNs). It is encouraging that the community working on CV research was called upon to provide assistance in combating the COVID-19 pandemic."

                "Price is the core element of commercial transactions and an important parameter of competition. One of antitrust law’s aims is to ensure that market prices form under the laws of supply and demand, and not after the whims of monopolists or cartelists. Innovations in <em>computer</em> and data <em>science</em> have brought about pricing technologies that rely on advanced analytics or machine learning (ML) techniques, which could strengthen existing bargaining power disparities in part by supporting price coordination among competitors. Existing research establishes a theoretical framework for competitive harm through coordination, showing that pricing technologies can lead to near-cartel price levels while avoiding anti-cartel prohibitions. This contribution builds on that framework, taking into account up to date empirical, game-theoretic, and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> literature on pricing technologies to produce a taxonomy of those technologies. We then employ a comparative approach to identify the legal effects of various pricing technologies at a more granular level under EU and US antitrust law. The contribution supports greater understanding between economists and policy-makers regarding the analysis and treatment of AI-based pricing technologies."

                "Bio-inspired computing is a field of study that Lois lee knits together subfields related to the connectionism, social behavior and emergence. It is often closely related to the field of artificial intelligence as many of its pursuits can be linked to machine learning. It relies heavily on fields of biology, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and mathematics. Briefly it is the use of <em>computers</em> to model the living phenomena and simultaneously the study of life to improve the usage of <em>computer</em>. Biologically inspired computation is a major subset of natural computation areas of research. Some areas of study encompassed under the canon of biologically inspired computing and their biological counterparts are, genetic algorithms, evolution, biodegradability prediction, biodegradation, cellular automata, life emergent system ants, termites, bees, wasps, neural networks, artificial immune systems rendering patterning and animal skins, bird feathers, mollusk shells and bacterial colonies. Linder Mayer systems, plant structures, communication networks and protocol, epidemiology and the spared of disease, intra membrane molecular processes in living cells, excitable media forest fires the wave heart conditions axons and sensor networks sensory organs. Optimization techniques takes more bottom-up decentralized approach and often involves the methods of specifying a set of simple rules, a set of simple organisms which adhere to those rules and method of iteratively applying those rules for example, training virtual insect to investigate to an unknown terrain for finding food includes six simple rules which can be adopted. After several generations of rules application, it is usually the case where some forms of complex behavior get built upon complexity until the end results is something markedly complex and quite often completely counterintuitive from what the original rules would be expected to produce. For this reason, most technology-oriented solutions like neural network models, algorithms and other techniques came in to existence for accurate measurements and analysis that can be used to refine statistical inference and extrapolation as system complexity increases. The rules of nature inspired computing are the principle simple rules yet after being used for over millions of years have produced remarkably complex optimization techniques. All these techniques for developing software applications along with optimization techniques are discussed in the chapter."

                "The most advanced kind of computing, known as quantum computing, makes use of the laws of quantum physics to generate unmatched processing capacity while using less energy than traditional <em>computers</em>. Quantum computing integrates physics, mathematics, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, and information theory to reach exponential speed and efficiency above conventional <em>computers</em> by modifying the behavior of microscopic particles like electrons, atoms, and photons. This chapter gives an overview of the key ideas in quantum computing. It begins with a brief history of classical computing and some of its drawbacks before exploring how quantum computing functions and the quantum properties, such as superposition, entanglement, and interference, which give it its power. This study investigates the architecture, hardware, software, design, types, and algorithms uniquely required by quantum <em>computers</em> in order to understand the possibility of a viable quantum <em>computer</em>. It emphasizes the several ways by which quantum computing can have an influence on a variety of industries, including artificial intelligence, traffic optimization, health, and cyber security. The chapter ends with a summary of the benefits and drawbacks of quantum <em>computers</em> as well as the current state of this promising topic. While small-scale quantum <em>computers</em> are being built, it is crucial to understand the background and constraints of conventional computing in order to fully grasp the potential advantages and disadvantages of this new technology."

                "What is data <em>science</em>? The simplest definition to come up with is, it is the study of data. The real-world data is raw and data <em>science</em> uses tools and techniques to extract meaningful information from the raw data. It incorporates different fields such as statistics, mathematics, <em>computer</em> engineering, machine learning, data miming, and artificial intelligence to analyze large amount of data. Nowadays there are various applications available to automatically capture and store this large amount of data such as online system and payment portals. Organizations are overwhelmed with this huge data and want to make inferences as to enhance business and productivity also to give users a better experience. Data <em>science</em> is helping to reveal gaps and uncovering new patterns take it from health, medicine, finance to e-commerce. Data <em>science</em> is a broader term, which consider multiple challenges, such as capturing, cleaning and transforming data to finally make inferences from it. Whereas data mining is mainly about extracting knowledge and unknown patterns from the huge amount of data hence it is also called “knowledge discovery process”. On the other hand, machine learning is an automated technique which uses complex algorithms for data processing and providing trained model output or we can say that it is a technique to train model on the given data and make predictions. Artificial Intelligence goes one step ahead and uses machine learning algorithm to make intelligent systems which can work on their own. These techniques have made data processing faster and much more efficient. It is because of different expertise required in this field, data <em>science</em> is showing strong growth."

                "Random walks, including the Nomadic Lévy Walk, play a crucial role in various <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> domains such as networking, distributed systems, and optimization. The Nomadic Lévy Walk, a variant of the Homesick Lévy Walk, holds promise as a potential candidate for message ferry routing schemes. This approach combines the homing behavior characteristic of the Homesick Lévy Walk with the base relocation strategy employed in Lévy walks. In Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) routing, encounter probability is a critical factor. In this paper, we present simulation results that highlight the impact of base relocation in the Nomadic Lévy Walk on encounter probability. Additionally, we conduct thorough comparisons of encounter probabilities using unit-disk graphs with varying diameters to further investigate the efficacy of the Nomadic Lévy Walk approach."

                "According to James Brown, the executive director of the STEM Education Coalition in Washington, D.C., “STEM is the future of the economy. “There will be work there in the future.“ That claim is supported by data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). It is anticipated that between 2012 and 2022, employment in professions related to STEM (<em>science</em>, technology, engineering, and mathematics) will increase to more than 9 million. That represents an increase in employment of roughly 1 million jobs from 2012 levels. This article examines roughly 100 professions from a list compiled by a group made up of representatives from various federal agencies, giving readers an overview of STEM work. The article’s introduction provides a succinct overview of the subjects of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, engineering, mathematics, and the life and physical <em>sciences</em>. The second half of the report contains information on the STEM professions with the highest employment, as well as predicted job vacancies and growth. The benefits and difficulties of STEM job are covered in the third part. How to get ready for a profession in a STEM field is covered in the fourth section. The article’s conclusion includes a list of references for additional information."

                "Personas represent distinct user or customer groups in design, human-<em>computer</em> interaction, and marketing. Persona analytics refers to creating data-driven personas, often employing data <em>science</em> and machine learning algorithms, to address customer analytics use cases. Through persona analytics, various customer segments can become more salient, observable, and approachable for managers and other decision managers without losing the objectivity of quantitative data. In this chapter, we discuss the definition of persona analytics, reasons for its existence, potential use cases for persona analytics, and future directions for employing personas in web and social media analytics."

                "Despite of the behemoth utilization of social media platforms for various aspects, which provides opportunities to analyze and study the social behavior of users, text mining’s role has been not explored fully. For this, text mining is the way to discover interesting patterns in data. The motive of text mining is to utilize discovered patterns to elucidate contemporary behavior or to predict future outcomes. Multiple disciplines participate in crawling text to discover required textual patterns such as mathematical modeling, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, data mining and warehousing to name a few. For this purpose, embeddings are also playing a key role and under the umbrella of machine learning, IoT (Internet of things) are coping up flawlessly at an individual level to predict the behavior in terms of security privacy, analysis, and prediction. Through this chapter, explaining the role of such strategies in social media text analysis for finding knowledgeable patterns. To illustrate and deliberate the areas of social media which are reachable on an amazing variety in the field of text mining using IoT-enabled services in terms of machine learning are also described. Outcomes can provide as a baseline for future of IoT research based on machine learning in emerging applications."

                "In recent trends, geospatial-artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has provided enormous opportunities and challenges to active earth research. Theoretical advances, big data, <em>computer</em> hardware, and robust data processing platforms that enable the creation, training, and deployment of GeoAI prototypes quickly are the driving forces behind its rapid development. The automation of geospatial studies and artificial intelligence, particularly <em>computer</em> vision techniques and the most recent intelligent systems, including research and industry, has made significant strides in recent years. Besides attention to spatial contexts and ancestries in topography or geospatial <em>science</em>, GeoAI can be defined as the study of intelligent <em>computer</em> programs that simulate human perception, spatial cognition, and realization about spatial occurrences and evolution; extend our information; and solve problems in the human natural ecosystem and their contexts. In this study, the usefulness of a manual survey is based on experience. Still, other technology serves a consoling job in a fast, systematic approach to evaluating the spatial feature using the application of GeoAI. This GeoAI-based technique has played a pivotal role in the spread of accurate measurement-based information. Besides this, the case study location at the Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad (IIT-DHN), Jharkhand campus, included multiple areas such as roadways, buildings, vegetation, water tanks, etc. So, it has utilized GeoAI for feature discrimination to spot linked map terrain dilemmas at reconnaissance (1:250,000) levels. It is also critical for the development and future shape of prediction."

                "Today, with the expansion of the population, an increase in various diseases can be seen this phenomenon grows the risk of contracting unknown diseases in the world. Therefore, in recent years, more attention has been paid to the development of new methods for the diagnosis and treatment of patients, which can be referred to efforts made to develop new medicines and diagnostic tools. With using these tools and new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, patients' data with great accuracy are collected and analyzed; a huge transformation in the field of treatment is tacked place. The design of intelligent medical devices has a high impact on the faster recognition and treatment of patients. On the other hand, making a relationship between patients and medical devices can have a positive effect on the treatment of patients. Patients who can feel relaxed and comfortable during the treatment will put more effort into their own treatment. A smart medical device, which has a friendly user interface with the patient, has a positive role in the treatment of patients. Patient experience is a part of user experience that describes the interaction between patients and medical devices. In the concept of patient experiences, the experience of illness and also the way of healthcare are examined. So, the role of human-machine interaction (HMI) systems should not be ignored in the field of treatment. In the field of treatment, HMI refers to facilitating communication between humans and machines. So, the goal of the designing system based on HMI is important to encourage patients to seek treatment and give them hope for life during their treatment period according to their age conditions. For example, the patient's age is an important criterion that should be considered in the design of a human-<em>computer</em> interaction system. Also, the gender of patients plays a role in communicating between patients and medical devices. On other hand, the role of artificial intelligence in designing human-<em>computer</em> interaction systems cannot be ignored. This type of system can prevent disease by checking the patient's condition, predicting the patient's condition during the treatment period based on the patient's personality, and also can decide using decision-making systems. Also, recommender systems can use intelligent medical devices to treat patients according to the predictions made. Accurate diagnosis of medical devices according to the physical and mental conditions of the patient is an important point that affects HMI systems. Actually, an HMI system should be able to identify patients' mental states by using powerful sensors and facial image processing in order to be a user-friendly interface for the medical system. In this chapter, various factors and their solutions that can play a role in the design of an HMI system are examined."

                "Human-machine interface or HMI is quite omnipresent today due to its innumerable advantages in various fields from basic everyday vending machines to massive and complex industrial operations. Its only goal is to make machines more user-friendly and automatic so that they may be operated with a single-button press as opposed to having it done manually. It is incredibly helpful in some of the most significant healthcare and life <em>sciences</em> areas by allowing lucid and coherent communication between a human and a machine. By providing efficient patient monitoring systems and keeping track of some of the crucial factors like blood pressure, oxygen levels, ECG monitors, etc. They can aid in speeding up the recovery of patients. Another regular execution of HMI in medical systems is the display monitors in hospitals, interfaces of medical equipment, touch screen devices, etc. portraying the accurate levels of a patient's daily health status. One of the main advantages of HMI is its potential to bridge the communication gaps even when physicians could not treat patients during pandemics like COVID. It has provided us with systems that can interconnect monitors in hospitals, which feed into a single or wide range of <em>computers</em> to consistently be updated about a patient's doses, medicine timings, treatment plan, etc. The capability of software or hardware to be able to transmit appropriate information to an end user in an uncomplicated way is what makes HMI more personalized and handier to the entire population. In this chapter, we have introduced HMI along with its origins and history and highlighted some of its most significant uses in various industries. Applications from areas, such as medicine, manufacturing, automation and processing, biomedical engineering, robotic surgery, etc., have also been highlighted, illuminating the function that HMIs and AI play and demonstrate how they have been a consistent support in a multitude of fields."

                "The branch of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and artificial intelligence known as machine learning is used to program machines to learn. Algorithms for machine learning are software programs or methods used to find hidden patterns in data, predict outcomes, and improve performance based on past performance. A technique used in machine learning called ensemble learning combines several models, such as classifiers or experts that have been carefully constructed to solve a particular computational intelligence problem. Ensemble refers to a collaborative effort to create a single impact. An ensemble can predict events more accurately and perform better in general than a single contributor. A random forest is a technique for ensemble learning in which many decision trees are combined to create the forest. This chapter covers the fundamentals of ensemble learning using random forest, implementation with realworld examples, and developing a model."

                "Generative artificial intelligence, anchored by large language models (LLMs), is significantly altering the educational landscape. This chapter examines the impact of generative AI on education, illustrating its capability to create personalized content and transform learning environments. Despite concerns over academic dishonesty facilitated by LLMs, the chapter argues against a regressive stance and advocates for the constructive integration of AI into educational practices. By drawing on theories of learning, the chapter elucidates the pedagogical implications of generative AI and describes specific use cases in language learning, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, and mathematics. Highlighting both the potential and limitations of this emerging technology, the chapter posits that generative AI is not merely a disruptive force, but a revolutionary tool poised to redefine the methodologies of teaching and learning."

                "Digitalization impacts the lives of billions of people in the world and increases the opportunity for every individual to explore and experience different perspectives of life. Digitalization is possible because of continuous innovation and inventions in information technology (IT) sector. IT is growing in an unprecedented pace, and these innovations are not only limited to IT but impact each sector like retail, healthcare, life <em>science</em>, and manufacturing. To be more concise, you name any sector, and you feel that somewhere they are using IT innovations to increase their productivity, efficiency, user experience (UX), fast delivery, easy collaboration, marketing, sales, and in these places where these innovations can give fruitful results. UX is the field which is always in demand because it attracts the consumer toward the product. Since nothing is constant and technology ever evolving, the latest innovation changes the way people think about the UX. These innovations are popularly known as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality. The VR can also be called as <em>computer</em>-generated reality. VR, AR and head-mounted displays are altering the way we see and cooperate with the world, influencing virtually every industry. These innovations are permitting three-dimensional (3D) vivid show and comprehension of life systems at no other time is conceivable. Clinical applications are widely coming to and influence each feature of clinical consideration from learning gross life systems and careful method to understand explicit pre-procedural arranging and intra-employable direction, just as symptomatic and restorative methodologies in recovery, torment the executives, and brain <em>science</em>. The FDA is starting to affirm these methodologies for clinical use. VR changes the way we can experience the image in 3D and AI is known for the decision making, have the capability to mimic the human decision in the absence of humans; so, on the basis of images generated by VR, AI can diagnose the disease in a much faster way and help our medical professionals with the appropriate recommendations. In this chapter, we sum up the utilization of AI with VR for healthcare. A set of experiences, current utility and future utilizations of these advancements are portrayed."

                "Identifying food freshness is a very important; it is a part of a long historical actions by humans, because fruit freshness can tell us the information about the quality of foods. With the advancement of machine learning and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, which will be broadly employed in factories and markets, instead of manual classification. Recognition of the freshness of food is rapidly being replaced by <em>computers</em> or robots. In this book chapter, the authors conduct the research work on fruit freshness detection, we make use of YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 in this project to implement fruit classifications based on a variety of digital images, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the classification incredibly; after the classification, the output will showcase the result of fruit fresheness classification, namely, fresh, or rotten, etc. They also compare the results of different deep learning models to discover which architecture is the best one in terms of speed and accuracy. At the end of this book chapter, the authors made use of the majority vote method to combine the results of different models to get better accuracy and recall scores. To generate the final result, the authors trained the three models individually, and also propose a majority vote to get a better performance for fresh fruit detection. Compared with the previous work, this method has higher accuracy and a much faster speed. Because this one uses the clustering method to generate the final result, it will be easy for researchers to change the backbone and get a better result in the future."

The Codeflex programming platform performs automatic evaluation of submitted solutions for a very diverse set of programming languages, in real time, considering the specificities and requirements of different programming paradigms, being prepared to analyze and detect plagiarism in tournament submissions. The use of Codeflex platform in a real context allowed the test and validation of its functionalities. In particular, several programming tournaments were organized, for Haskell and Prolog programming languages-functional and logic programming tournaments, respectively, within the scope of programming curricular units of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> undergraduate degree. The findings suggest that Codeflex is a valuable contribution in enhancing programming skills and providing an efficient evaluation system for educational and professional settings."

                "People today see blockchain as a technology that gave rise to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that many people now invest in. However, blockchain has so much more to it than just being the theory behind cryptocurrencies. The integration of Blockchain technologies with other technologies can open may new doors of opportunities. One such integration can be blockchain technologies with IoT. This will be the leading discussion in this chapter, along with the theory of blockchain and its evolution as the 'next big thing' in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. Within the next decade, blockchain will revolutionize business models among all industries and will provide new pathways for database management and might even influence peoples' lives and decisions. The chapter explores various benefits of blockchain and IoT integration, along with its issues, challan ages and examples."

                "Foreseeing trends and facilitating better decision-making, data analytics is a diverse field. Data analytics uses mathematics, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, and statistics to make use of the data beyond analytics. Data are used in a number of industries, including social security, commercial marketing, advertising, fraud detection, transportation, education, and internet site search, for prediction and framing techniques. With a focus on the healthcare industry, the chapter starts by presenting data analytics and its several subtypes, including descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and viewpoint analytics. Furthermore, a description of the fundamental abilities such as statistical, mathematical, and database access that are necessary to manage a wealth of healthcare data is offered. Patient preventative care, patient management, public health management, medication development, and healthcare fraud detection are among the applications of data analytics that are covered in the part examining how to improve the standard of care in the healthcare industry."

                "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a <em>science</em> by which we can simulate intelligent machines like <em>computers</em> and other digital assistants to mimic human intelligence. AI has many subsets, like deep learning, NLP, ML, robotics, and more. ML uses statistical methods to identify past human behaviour patterns to make a decision that was not fed into the system. Hence with the increase in the depth of the data, their prediction and decision-making improve. In the late 1970's a British company developed the CT scan device to obtain clear tomographic image; this diagnostic technique won a Nobel Prize. Since then, IP has found special applications in the medical field. This chapter attempts to give an overview of the most challenging and useful application of machine learning for image processing, which has led to the elimination of human errors and achieving perfect and precise decision-making. The compassion, caring, and human touch can never be replaced in patient care, but the intervention of machine learning in image processing gives superior insights for better decisions and improved health care."

                "Cybersecurity research is gaining a lot of importance in recent times. Bibliometric analysis of cyber security research showed major areas and their overlapping. Due to overlapping research areas with allied areas like system engineering, networking, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, information technology, management <em>science</em>, etc., the impact of cyber security research is often hard to gauge. This chapter aims to present the research dimension of cyber security as a number of use cases and an attempt to connect the researcher to understand research areas of cyber security and its complexities through use cases to make them visualize the problem better. In this chapter, the following use cases are presented and analyzed: the role of social media in cyber security issues, how traditional network-based attacks influence the IoT environment, the dynamics of malware and its impact on AI-based detection systems, and security in embedded systems."

                "Judea Pearl's ladder of causation framework has dramatically influenced the understanding of causality in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. Despite artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, grasping causal relationships remains challenging, emphasizing the causal revolution's significance in improving AI's understanding of cause and effect. The work presents a novel taxonomy of causal inference methods, clarifying diverse approaches for inferring causality from data. It highlights the implications of causality in responsible AI and explainable AI (xAI), addressing bias in AI systems. The chapter points out causality as the next step in AI for creating new questions, developing causal tools, and clarifying opaque models with xAI approaches. The work clarifies causal models' significance and implications in various AI subareas."

                "Almost every aspect of our life has benefited from the widespread use of cyberspace as the primary medium for the dissemination of information. Now more than ever, the rapid advancement of <em>science</em> and technology, in particular the quantum <em>computer</em>, is going to pose the greatest challenge to cyberspace security in the next years for the internet. Here, we analyze the characteristics of quantum cryptography and investigate its possible uses in the realm of online security. It is essential to keep in mind that the analysis of the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol that we carry out is carried out in a channel that is devoid of noise. Additionally, in order to simulate potential future uses of the internet, we search for the QKD protocol in noisy channels. Results show that quantum cryptography is absolutely secure, which is fine for the internet despite the imminent arrival of new dangers."

                "Quantum computing (QC) and, to a greater extent, quantum technologies are changing the world. In reality, QC is not an advancement of conventional <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> but rather a revolution that radically shifts the paradigm of computing. By basing its functioning on quantum physics ideas like aggregation and coherence, quantum <em>computers</em> seek to exponentially boost computing power. QC may very well be able to solve a variety of problems that have previously seemed insurmountable. The fact is that due to its many promising applications, QC is currently having an impact on most corporate sectors and scientific domains. Quantum algorithms need to be explicitly programmed for these vastly different machines in order for these applications to become a reality. Despite the fact that a few well-known quantum algorithms exist, the need for quantum software will skyrocket in the coming years. In that situation, it is necessary to generate quantum software in a more industrialized and controlled manner, taking into account factors like quality, delivery, project management, or evolution of quantum software. We are confident that a new piece of software will be primarily motivated by QC."

                "Modern computing technologies such as quantum computing (QC) are based on the amazing happenings of quantum physics. It's a beautiful blend of information theory, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, mathematics, and physics. By controlling the behavior of small physical things such as B. tiny particles such as atoms, higher processing power, lower power consumption and exponential speed compared to what conventional <em>computers</em> provide. This paper describes the architecture, hardware, software, types, and algorithms required only for quantum <em>computers</em> (QComp). It shows how QC can improve our lives from many angles, including artificial intelligence, traffic optimization, healthcare, and cybersecurity. In conclusion, we assess the importance, strengths and weaknesses of QComp. Recently, a small quantum <em>computer</em> was built. Focusing on the implications of a general-purpose quantum <em>computer</em>, we recommend studying the beginnings, possibilities, and limitations of today's conventional <em>computers</em> before considering the strengths of new technologies ahead. This knowledge helps us understand potential barriers to the development of novel, cutting-edge technologies. It also keeps us updated on ongoing progress in this area."

                "<em>Computer</em> <em>science's</em> branch of cryptography focuses on transforming data into encrypted formats that are imperceptible to unauthorized users. The process of securing format is called encryption. It has been used for centuries to halt unwanted recipients from reading communications. Traditional cryptography techniques either rely on a private key or a public key that is known to everybody. In either scenario, the eavesdroppers are able to identify the key and as a result, discover the message sent without the sender or receiver's awareness. A form of encryption known as quantum cryptography (Qcryp) takes advantage of some of the fundamental principles of quantum physics that uses inherent qualities to transmit and secure data in an uncrackable manner. Qcryp is a system that cannot be broken into without the transmitter or recipient of the message being aware of it. Qcryp employs the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), a method for dispersing random binary keys that allows communicating parties to identify potential listeners."

                "Cybersecurity, a field within <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>, is one of the fields most invested in by countries around the globe. Countries are expected to spend more than 1 trillion dollars on cybersecurity by the end of 2021. Recently, it was shown that around 45 percent of cyberattacks are successful. <em>Computer</em> forensics is one of the most sought-after jobs in the 21st century. Cyber forensics is the process of accumulation and storing of data from a device that can be presented in front of a judge in a court. There are multiple forms of Digital Forensics. Some of them include Disk and network forensics and wireless forensics, among numerous others. The aim of this study is to find out what the future holds for us in the field of cybersecurity and cyber forensics around the world and ways to improve the existing technology, as well as creating new technology to catch the notorious hackers around the world. The methodology would mainly involve educating people about the threats they face in the online world as well as assessing the situation right now and predicting what the future in these two vast fields holds. This study if implemented would surely make the online world a much more secure place by preserving one's personal data as well as encouraging humankind to reach its maximum potential in these two respective fields."

                "The globe is currently creating massive volumes of data, with data output in recent years increasing at an unprecedented rate. Most of this additional knowledge is being collected in novel ways, and technological developments allow it to be stored and analysed much more efficiently than usual. Against this background, there has been a lot of recent discussion about big data and data <em>science</em>. That is the capacity to analyse and derive valuable implications from increasing amounts of data from various sources quicker than ever. Data <em>science</em> is already transforming many facets of modern life, and it has enormous potential to foster innovations in the insurance sector. Insurers have traditionally collected information to understand premiums and risks better. Data <em>science</em>, coupled with increased <em>computer</em> capacity, provides a step-change in vulnerability assessment by allowing insurers to observe these risks in much greater depth continually. This can benefit insurers and policyholders, with room for innovations in how insurance is presented and priced and how claims are managed. As customers' aspirations of all sorts of information, ability to respond quickly, and ways of conducting business rise, so will their expectations of the insurance sector. This chapter discusses many machine learning algorithms for effectively analysing insurance claims and comparing their performance using various criteria."

                "Starting with Freud's concept of the psychic machine (Entwurf; Interpretation of Dreams; Beyond the Pleasure Principle) I will discuss Lacan's effort to elaborate this view with the help of 20th-century research areas (<em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, linguistics, cybernetics, molecular biology, etc.), resulting in the famous theorem that the unconscious is structured as a language. Subsequently, two closely related questions will be addressed, resulting from a mutual encounter between psychoanalysis and AI, namely: How can psychoanalysis contribute to coming to terms with AI and to what extent does AI allow us to update psychoanalytic theories of the unconscious?"

                "Research and innovation in the domain of technology have seen a strong transformation to transdisciplinary collaboration in recent years. Fields like Artificial Intelligence have amplified their scope, transcending through various disciplines of <em>science</em> and engineering. In the domain of healthcare in Latin America, digital transformation through data <em>science</em> has extended from the top to bottom, extending from digital administration and data-backed healthcare policies on one hand, smart eHealth devices and intelligent monitoring through Internet of Things and machine learning, on the other hand. The third sustainable development goal of the United Nations is \"good health and well-being.\" In this aspect, Artificial Intelligence plays a strong role in predictive, preventive, participatory, and personalized healthcare. This chapter focuses on a holistic view of the digital transformation of healthcare in Latin America through Artificial Intelligence and transdisciplinary cooperation. It is based on the following aspects - strategic collaboration between the medical and engineering domains like physics, electronics, statistics, biology, and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> for seamless transfer of technology, harnessing data <em>science</em> tools of machine learning for accurate predictions of diseases, thus exercising preventive healthcare, and integration of education, research, and innovation through international academic and scientific collaborations. This work illustrates the focal goal of providing healthcare services following best practices through digital data-powered transformations and transdisciplinary exchange around medicine and bioengineering in a Latin American perspective."

                "It has always been difficult to communicate and interact with those people who are unable to speak or listen. Human translators somewhat try to bridge the communication gap between the deaf-mute community and those who do not know how to read and use the sign language. However, they are limited in number and are not available everywhere, all the time. So, to solve this problem, we can use various <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> technologies to detect and classify the sign language gestures. This chapter proposes a system to detect and recognize dynamic Nepali Sign Language (NSL) in real time using a deep learning technique with the help of <em>computer</em> vision. The proposed approach takes video input from the user, extracts its frames, and classifies the sequence of images using a combined model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We have used InceptionV3, a transfer learning approach to extract spatial features and LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to recognize the temporal features. The dataset is collected manually by capturing videos using a smartphone for five different classes."

                "A branch of forensic <em>science</em> called \"digital forensics\" deals with the utilization of digital data received, maintained, and conveyed by electronic devices as evidence in inquiries and legal proceedings. It is a growing field in computing that frequently necessitates the intelligent analysis of large amounts of complex data. Rapid advancements in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and information technology enable the development of novel techniques and software for digital investigations. Initially, much of the analysis software was unique and proprietary, but over time, specialised analysis software for both the private and governmental sectors became available. The aim of this chapter is to deliver a comprehensive overview of digital forensics phases, applications, merits, and demerits and widely used software of the domain. The chapter also discusses legitimate and legal considerations, followed by the scope and role of artificial intelligence for solving complex problems of digital forensics."

                "This chapter's major goal is to examine the issue of real-world recognition to enhance species preservation. As it is a popular topic and a crucial one, the authors focus on identifying plant species. The examples are scanned specimens in traditional plant species identification, and the setting is plain. Real-world species recognition, on the other hand, is more difficult. They begin by looking at realistic species recognition and how it differs from traditional plant species recognition. Interdisciplinary teamwork based on the newest breakthroughs in technology and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> is provided to cope with the difficult challenge. In this research, they offer a unique framework for deep learning as well as an effective data augmentation strategy. They crop the image before everyone is aware in terms of visual attention. Furthermore, they use it as a data augmentation technique. Attention cropping (AC) is the name given to a revolutionary data augmentation technique. To predict species from a significant quantity of information, fully convolutional neural networks (CNN) are constructed."

                "AI has the potential to revolutionize education by enhancing student performance and delivering tailored learning experiences. This chapter addresses the present state of artificial intelligence (AI) in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> (CS) education, as well as how it is used to adaptive learning, intelligent learning systems, and automated grading. The authors examine recent studies on the use of AI in CS teaching, emphasizing the relative benefits of various approaches. One of the technology's most important benefits is its ability to customize courses to the interests and learning preferences of particular students in CS education. Using data analytics, adaptive learning systems evaluate student performance and offer personalized feedback and improvement recommendations. Intelligent tutoring systems offer adaptable and interactive learning environments by using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP)."

                "Quantum machine learning incorporates quantum algorithms into machine learning programs. Medical researchers now routinely use machine learning to predict disease in a variety of ways, such as by generating models to predict drug response, identifying disease subtypes, and developing innovative therapies. A computing model has the ability to enhance medical pictures make analysis by using techniques such as edge detection, and verify whether medical pictures are matching or not. Quantum <em>computers</em>, which are exponentially faster and more capable than conventional <em>computers</em>, have the potential to transform the entire industry, with proponents claiming they could save the healthcare system hundreds of billions of dollars while improving patient care. Quantum models were initiated as a multidisciplinary model, with effort encompassing sectors like digital systems and quantum physics. Now is the period to expand the discipline by embracing novel associations and firms with materials <em>science</em>. This chapter examines a project that use quantum computing to solve a significant issue with medical datasets: small size, which is a result of their limited samples, materials, sensing, and communication."

                "Quantum computing (QC) is the emerging technology for solving complex problems through the laws of quantum mechanism and optimized algorithms. To examine the possibilities of active cooperation across both disciplines of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, this article explains the core components of quantum computing and conveys some of the important features linked by quantum computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI). To make major progress with artificial intelligence, quantum computing is probably necessary. Quantum computing's training and processing power can be used to improve AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms at a reduced cost. AI can provide quantum <em>computers</em> with crucial error-correcting algorithms. Several AI algorithms have been successfully applied to quantum <em>computers</em>; they are constrained by the computational power of conventional <em>computers</em> despite developing useful applications. Artificial intelligence may benefit from quantum computing's computational boost in order to handle more challenging issues. This case study explains the importance of quantum computing, the future of QC in AI, and the different applications of quantum computing, such as AI and ML, cybersecurity and cryptography, and weather forecasting."

                "Various innovations in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and engineering have revolutionized the processes involved in human interaction and social transactions. The Metaverse is one such technology that creates a virtual world replicating all the opportunities similar to the real world. In simplified terms, the Metaverse is a digital virtual space developed using three-dimensional technologies to mimic the real world through virtual reality technologies. The Metaverse has tremendous potential to improve human sustainability benefiting the entire ecosystem. In this chapter, the authors first present the fundamentals of blockchain and discuss how blockchain can be used to solve major challenges in the Metaverse. Then, they provide various use cases of blockchain in the Metaverse, including privacy, security, traceability, decentralization, ownership, governance, and trust accountability. Next, the authors demonstrate the use of blockchain in the Metaverse via several real projects."

                "Boolean networks are used more and more to model gene regulation networks and signaling pathways taking into account a large number of entities. This chapter presents the formalism of Boolean networks and their relation to classic models from fundamental <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, in particular with Petri nets with different update semantics. Motivated by the modeling of biological systems, it focuses on the most permissive (MP) semantics of Boolean networks that makes sure to capture any behavior possible with any quantitative model respecting the logic of the network. Boolean networks are commonly used to model systems whose state of components are not binary. The chapter looks at some property guarantees obtained on a Boolean network regarding more quantitative models, such as multivalued networks, or systems with ordinary differential equations. It provides the complexities for the decision of different usual dynamical properties (fixed points, reachability, attractors) for classical semantics and MP."

                "We propose a set of architectural patterns that describe a large variety of neuro-symbolic systems. As in other areas of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> (knowledge engineering, software engineering, ontology engineering, process mining and others), such design patterns provide a unified vocabulary to describe a large variety of systems, help to systematise the literature, clarify which combinations of techniques serve which purposes, and encourage re-use of software components. We have validated our set of compositional design patterns against a large body of recent literature, and we apply them to a number of systems described in the different sections of this volume. Sections 1.1-1.7 of this chapter are based on our earlier publications [1] and [2], the new contributions of this chapter are in section 1.5 and 1.6.

                "In addition to other cutting-edge <em>computer</em> technologies, the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and others have been used in agriculture. However, there is currently increased focus on the use of such technologies. It is now possible to monitor the agricultural environment and ensure high-quality production through cutting-edge IoT technologies in amalgamation with nanoscience. Nanotechnology is the branch of <em>science</em> that deals with manipulating materials on a nanoscale. By encountering problems that cannot be solved conventionally, working with the smallest particles imaginable inspires hopes for enhancing agricultural productivity. By releasing fixed nutrients, efforts are made to restore soil fertility in the management aspects. Nano biosensors and satellite systems are used to assess the input needs for crops in controlled conditions for agriculture and precision farming, and the necessary amounts are then delivered at the correct moment. These disadvantages can be addressed by various cyber-physical systems, that is briefly explained in this chapter."

                "Systems engineering deals with the development of complex systems where complexity is usually product domain-specific. Thus, it often fails to a large extent to integrate the mechanical and electrical engineering disciplines with the <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> discipline, including cultural issues. However, the success of future cyber-physical systems depends not only on hardware functionality but also progressively on its integration into distributed software functionality. The presented Advanced Digital Twin combines the prerequisites for efficient hardware and software integration, particularly for large and complex systems, like cyber-physical systems. Therefore, it is based on an Advanced System Model which comprises the respective architectural designs needed by the domains involved. Based on this resilient integrated architecture, the emerging artifacts can be reused which makes the application of model-based techniques economically reasonable. This enables automated quality checks, simulations, application of artificial intelligence, and big data analysis and serves as a thread through necessary cultural changes to set up a cross-functional and t-shaped collaboration."

                "We propose a set of architectural patterns that describe a large variety of neuro-symbolic systems. As in other areas of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> (knowledge engineering, software engineering, ontology engineering, process mining and others), such design patterns provide a unified vocabulary to describe a large variety of systems, help to systematise the literature, clarify which combinations of techniques serve which purposes, and encourage re-use of software components. We have validated our set of compositional design patterns against a large body of recent literature, and we apply them to a number of systems described in the different sections of this volume. Sections 1.1-1.7 of this chapter are based on our earlier publications [1] and [2], the new contributions of this chapter are in section 1.5 and 1.6."

                "Online learning witnessed a shift in the attention of educators and e-learning specialists from transfer of knowledge-to-knowledge building and management, seeking to enhance innovative approaches while redefining better processes of learning. This is the case with this smart virtual learning environment (VLE), called Scholar. The authors have taken full advantage of new e-learning affordances to pedagogically design and develop it based on a reflexive ideology whereby complex reasoning skills such as critical and creative thinking form part of the process. Additionally, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> collaborators employed available learning analytics and data mining techniques to automate critical thinking assessment through topic modelling, as well as semantically analyzing text to assess peer reviews. The purpose of this chapter is to report on the work done to extend both these lines of research and to document results from an empirical study in the form of in-class experiences in an attempt to address student needs in the next stage of online learning."

                "Now in this modern era, we are exploring technology and <em>science</em>, in the same scenarios, we are also trying to explore a popular technology named \"Deep-Learning\", which is a giant technology in the software industry around the world. Here in this chapter, we start with the basic concept of deep learning including the framework and library frequently used to develop such types of applications. Further, in the middle part various deep learning models were discussed with a practical approach using the MNIST dataset. These models are used for solving various complex problems in the domain of <em>computer</em> vision and natural language processing. At the end of this chapter, we are also trying to introduce some emerging and interdisciplinary domains associated with deep learning and artificial intelligence. However, this chapter contains only the core concept of deep learning technology, and it might be fruitful for a beginner in this area."

                "Agriculture plays a significant role in the sector of the economy. Computerization in agriculture is the most important concern and an emerging subject across the world. The population is growing exponentially and with this increase, the demand for food and employment is also increasing. The conventional methods which were utilized by the farmers were not enough to complete these requirements. Thus, computerized automated methods were introduced. These new methods assure the food requirements and also provided many employment opportunities to billions of people. Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> in agriculture and resulted in an agricultural revolution. This type of technology has played a major role in the security of crop yield from various factors like climate changes, growth of population, issues in employment, and the security of food. The main concern of this chapter is to compile the various applications of Artificial intelligence in agriculture as irrigation, weeding, spraying with sensors, and other means embedded in robots and drones. These technologies are very valuable for the conservation of water as well as to reduce the excessive use of pesticides, herbicides, in maintaining soil fertility, it also helps in the efficient use of manpower and promote productivity and also improve quality."

                "<em>Computer</em> <em>science</em> encompasses various subfields, with data structures and algorithms being important. This chapter aims to enhance proficiency in constructing and analyzing data structures effectively. Studying data structures equips students with the skills to solve real-world problems using suitable structures. The study of data structures offers diverse programming techniques for complex problems yet introduces challenges due to intricate complexities that reshape program architecture. Covering all aspects in a single semester is impractical, as data structures receive extensive attention in graduate, upper-division, and lower-division programs. This text is an introductory resource for the stack, queue, linked list, graph, trees, searching, and sorting algorithms. It also offers insights into their Python implementation and its complexities, applications, and sample code."

                "Utilization of Man-made reasoning (simulated intelligence) has expanded in medical services in numerous areas. Associations from medical services of various sizes, types, and strengths are presently a day's keener on how man-made consciousness has advanced and is helping patient necessities and their consideration, likewise diminishing expenses, and expanding effectiveness. This review investigates the ramifications of <em>computer</em>-based intelligence on medical services the executives and difficulties associated with utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) in medical care alongside the audit of a few examination papers that pre-owned <em>computer</em>-based intelligence models in various areas of medical services like Dermatology, Radiology, Medication plan and so forth Computerized reasoning (man-made intelligence) intend to imitate human intellectual capacities. We study the current status of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical services and examine its future. Simulated intelligence can be applied to different sorts of medical services information (organized and unstructured). Significant sickness regions that utilization <em>computer</em>-based intelligence devices incorporate malignancy, nervous system <em>science</em> and cardiology. We then, at that point, audit in more subtleties the <em>computer</em>-based intelligence applications in stroke, in the three significant spaces of early discovery and finding, treatment, just as result expectation and forecast assessment. The medical services industry faces difficulties in fundamental regions like electronic record the executives, information combination, and PC supported conclusions and infection forecasts. It is important to lessen medical care costs and the development of customized medical services. The quickly growing fields of profound learning and prescient examination have begun to assume an urgent part in the development of a huge volume of medical care information practices and exploration. Profound learning offers a wide scope of instruments, strategies, and systems to address these difficulties. Wellbeing information prescient examination is arising as an extraordinary instrument that can empower more proactive and protection treatment choices. More or less, this chapter center around the system for profound learning information examination to clinical dynamic portrays the review on different profound learning procedures and devices practically speaking just as the utilizations of profound learning in medical care. Over the previous decade, profound learning has made striking progress in different man-made reasoning exploration regions. Developed from the past research on fake neural organizations, this innovation has shown better execution than other AI calculations in regions, for example, picture, and voice acknowledgment, regular language handling, among others. Lately, the main rush of uses of profound learning in drug research has arisen, and its utility has gone past bioactivity expectations. It has shown guarantee in resolving assorted issues in drug revelation. Models will be examined covering bioactivity forecast, once more atomic plan, amalgamation expectation and organic picture investigation. Profound learning is one of the most intriguing and quickly developing strategies in Man-made brainpower. Consequently, the interesting limit of profound learning models to take in designs from the information separates it from other AI methods. Profound learning is answerable for a critical number of late forward leaps in AI. In any case, profound learning models are exceptionally reliant upon the fundamental information. Thus, consistency, exactness, and culmination of information are fundamental for a profound learning model. Our contextual analysis is expected to give significant experiences to the profound learning local area just as for information researchers to direct conversation and future examination in applied profound learning with certifiable information. Notwithstanding the enormous contrasts among creating and created nations, access is a significant issue in country wellbeing all throughout the planet. Indeed, even in the nations where most of the populace lives in provincial regions, the assets are packed in the urban communities. All nations experience issues with transport and correspondence, and they all face the test of deficiencies of specialists and other wellbeing experts in provincial and far-off regions."

                "Education is the foundation of modern-day society. India being the land of knowledge, our education system is one of the oldest systems. With the change in time, the education system modifies itself for the betterment of society. The current educational system is introduced by the English, during their colonial rules, where the education is imparted to the students in an institute via classroom teaching. Previously to this, the students go to the GURUKUL where the learning was carried out traditionally. The education system introduced by the English is a more organized and modernized one, which spread education, in a better way to the bottom of the society. The education system is consisting of institutes, the teachers, the students, and the policymaker, which includes Government and Educationists. A good education policy is a help to build the society and the nation, as the students are the future of the nation. <em>Science</em> and technology play a major role in the betterment of the quality of education to the student. The <em>computer</em> and the internet are an integral part of our educational process. The use of the <em>computer</em> and the internet make it easier to access learning materials across the globe, which helps to increase in efficiency of the teaching profession and the students. The visualization and presentation make it more effective. The internet is also making it possible to access expert teaching professionals for a remote place. Currently, in the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the internet provides an alternative platform for teaching or educating the student. The online education process, which initially limited to the seminar, webinar. In the COVID-19 situation, all the government or private offices, business organizations, and educational institutes are closed, the online process is adapted as an alternative. The online teaching process of education is well-adapted, where all activities are carried out using the internet. To make it more effective, we need to define and use a database. The database will contain all the information so that the persons involving can access and use it for their purpose like a teacher looking for attendance of the student, internal assessment, etc., the student can access the classroom materials and other information similar to the management level personal look information to make smooth running of the process in their institutes. The database is needed to be intelligent by using data analytics, which analyses the data or information from the database, it can provide proper information to the faculty member, the students, and management personal to make better decision and carry out action, which makes more efficient and can make the online education to be robust."

                "In our ever-changing world, learning is an essential part of everyone's daily routine. The traditional approach to education relies on students applying what they have learned from textbooks and professors in the classroom to real-world circumstances. The use of cutting-edge technology in teaching and learning techniques is critical in today's digital world. Information and communication technology (ICT) is a major focus for universities. These are important scientific instruments with the potential to have an impact on how people learn and teach <em>science</em>. Three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR) interfaces give an experience via e-learning activities, software games, and simulated labs. Using VR, users may see, modify, and interact with <em>computer</em> systems and massive amounts of data. The term \" visualization\" refers to a <em>computer's</em> ability to provide the user with sensory inputs such as visual, aural, or any other combination of these. E-learning may benefit from the realistic virtual environments that VR and web technologies can create. 3D graphics have been made possible by the development of web technologies such as HTML, JAVA, and the Virtual Reality Modeling Language. Issues linked to employing a VR application as a medium for students to study and gain practical knowledge about a place shown in a virtual environment are discussed in this chapter."

                "Big data platform components like Hadoop, data lakes, and NoSQL have made big data architectures more logical, enabling businesses to pursue insightdriven competitive advantage. Moving corporate data to these platforms, especially when dealing with distributed data across data centers, is hampered by security issues, complicated data structures, issues with moving historical data, big volumes, latency issues, and variable speed of ingestion. In contrast to a unified platform for insights, we discovered that the majority of enterprises are developing various repositories and platforms. One of the techniques that can assist in identifying probable in the social and medical <em>sciences</em> is a statistical tool. Using statistical techniques, it is possible to identify data creation a mixture of data sets from legitimate and false. Fabrication of data calls into question the scientific method's quest for knowledge, undermines the reliability of results that have been published, and makes it harder to detect. Over the past 10 years, automated tools have been employed as screening methods to find image alteration and plagiarism in articles that have been submitted or accepted quantitative and founded on behavioral observations, surveys, (cognitive) tests, and so on. At any point in the research process, incorrect data might be found using computerized systems that automatically discover and screen articles for statistical anomalies. These screening procedures appear to be useful and effective in identifying the various types of research misconduct, according to numerous case studies. The picture detection technologies, for instance, are essentially useless in the disciplines of social media and medical <em>science</em> because the data are mostly quantitative."

                "Environmental sustainability is one of the major global topics of the 21st century. In order to effectively include the concept of sustainability in the topic of environmental education, educators are responsible for incorporating the concept into the existing curriculum. However, it may not always be possible to conduct field studies based on environmental education due to economic, transport, and time constraints, while certain situations and conditions may be particularly difficult to replicate. One recent solution to this problem is the application of Virtual Reality technology, which has been shown in various recent studies. VR is a <em>computer</em>-generated three-dimensional environment that allows the user to perceive content more realistically. In the process of teaching sustainability issues such as climate change, waste management, food consumption, air and water pollution, and deforestation, the present study has revealed that cooperation between different fields of expertise, including <em>science</em> education and <em>computer</em> and instructional technologies, plays an important role."

                "As data <em>science</em> applies to mapping buildings, great attention has been given to the potential of using deep learning and new data sources. However, given that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) dominate image classification tasks, automating the building extraction process is becoming more and more common. Increased access to unstructured data (such as imagery and text) and developments in deep learning and <em>computer</em> vision algorithms have improved the possibility of automating the extraction of building attributes from satellite images in a cost-effective and large-scale manner. By applying intelligent software-based solutions to satellite imageries, the manual process of acquiring features such as building footprints can be expedited. Manual feature acquisition is time-consuming and expensive. The buildings may be recovered from RGB photos and are extremely properly identified. This chapter offers suggestions to quicken the development of DL-centred building extraction techniques using remotely sensed images."

                "This chapter gives a broad outline of machine learning and artificial intelligence and introduces the reader to many novel and most recent developments in the field of machine learning. The first half of this compilation provides an all-round view of the classical concepts of machine learning, namely: ensemble learning, concept of big data, handling of big data, and predictive data analytics using big data. Examples of machine learning (ML) frameworks are discussed, which are <em>computer</em> vision (CV), swarm algorithm, network <em>science</em>/graph theory and applications in machine learning, Bioinformatics using machine learning, and internet of things (IoT). A side note-R language is added as is the second most common language used worldwide for machine learning and this chapter spotlights mostly on Python language for ML. Deep learning, concepts, models, types, and algorithms in machine learning are elaborated in the subsequent section, followed by a detailed introduction to Neural networks, concepts of weight initialization, propagation, and vanishing gradient problem."

                "The rapid innovations in <em>computer</em> <em>sciences</em> and the emergence of technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), metaverse, and similar cyberspaces have greatly impacted the field of education. The radical changes that IR4.0 has made in the teaching approaches and learning behaviours have posed new challenges for students of literary studies in academia. This chapter aims to examine the learning behaviours and challenges of literature students in Malaysian tertiary education in the context of IR4.0. Specifically, the study explores how digital and virtual world has impacted the teaching and learning of literature in academia and thereby seeks to suggest ways to overcome them. It is concluded that effective instruction of literature courses in IR4.0 era requires a combination of pedagogical approaches, technological tools, and cultural sensitivity as well as an effective convergence of the real and the virtual worlds."

                "This chapter illustrates how artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to analyze big data for the benefit of socioeconomic stakeholders. The research question was how state-of-the-art AI software could be used to help decision makers, particularly after major global crises such as climate change, natural disasters, and pandemics. In this chapter, the issues and controversies of big data and AI software are discussed. After an extensive literature review, this chapter proposes, develops, and tests an AI model using big data and AI statistical software. The concept was proven with sample data and a simulation. This AI big data modeling concept is argued to be valuable to many socioeconomic stakeholders, including <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> researchers and academic scholars."

Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), traditional neural networks, fuzzy logic, and speech recognition are only a few of the subsets of AI that have distinctive skills and functions that might enhance the performance of contemporary medical <em>sciences</em>. Biomedical imaging might undergo a revolution thanks to AI, which could increase the efficiency and precision of picture processing and interpretation. Radiologists could miss tiny abnormalities that can be detected by AI systems that have been taught to spot patterns in those pictures that are challenging for humans to interpret. AI may also be used to generate customized medicine by evaluating a patient's medical pictures and other data to customize treatment regimens, as well as to enhance image processing and visualization."

                "There is a strong consensus that quantum <em>computers</em> are likely to solve previously intractable problems, especially in data <em>science</em> and AI. Nowadays, processing power of machine learning algorithms is limited by that of conventional <em>computers</em>. Quantum computing (QC) is one of the digital trends with the quickest rate of growth, and it seems to provide an answer to large data problems. It is a combination of the fields of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, information theory, and quantum physics. Quantum <em>computers</em> use the ability of subatomic particles to exist in more than one state at once to solve complex problems. In spite of its recent origin, quantum computing is already being used in the field of data analytics. QC can process huge datasets at much quicker rates and can provide data to AI models. By comparing schemas to swiftly assess and comprehend the link between two counterparts, QC can also aid in the integration of data. The ability to perform more sophisticated analysis and build machine learning models is a benefit of employing quantum <em>computers</em>."

                "This chapter discusses the development and implementation of algorithms based on Equation-Free/Dynamic Data-Driven Applications Systems (EF/DDDAS) protocols for the <em>computer</em>-assisted study of the bifurcation structure of complex dynamical systems, such as those that arise in biology (neuronal networks, cell populations), multiscale systems in physics, chemistry, and engineering, and system modeling in the social <em>sciences</em>. An illustrative example demonstrates the experimental realization of a chain of granular particles (a so-called engineered granular chain). In particular, the focus is on the detection/stability analysis of time-periodic, spatially localized structures referred to as “dark breathers.” Results in this chapter highlight, both experimentally and numerically, that the number of breathers can be controlled by varying the frequency as well as the amplitude of an “out-of-phase” actuation, and that a “snaking” structure in the bifurcation diagram (computed through standard, model-based numerical methods for dynamical systems) is also recovered through the EF/DDDAS methods operating on a black-box simulator. The EF/DDDAS protocols presented here are, therefore, a step toward general-purpose protocols for performing detailed bifurcation analyses directly on laboratory experiments, not only on their mathematical models, but also on measured data."

                "Adding game elements to higher education is an increasingly common practice. As a result, many recent empirical studies focus on studying the effectiveness of gamified or game-based educational experiences. The findings of these studies are very diverse, showing both positive and negative effects, and thus calling for comparative meta-studies. In this paper we review and analyze different studies, aiming to summarise and evaluate controlled experiments conducted within different scientific disciplines. We focus on the clarity of non-experimental conditions’ descriptions and show that in most cases (a) educational methods used in control groups’ activities are poorly described, (b) educational materials used in control groups’ activities are often unclear, and (c) the starting conditions are unclear. We also noticed that studies in the fields of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and engineering, in general, report results more clearly than in other fields. Based on the above finding, we conclude with a few recommendations for the execution of future empirical studies of games in education for the sake of allowing a more structured comparison."

                "Serious gaming is becoming fundamental for reducing the initial effort of studying highly complex and extremely technical subjects. Cybersecurity is no exception as it is in general perceived as one of the most difficult fields in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. This happens because cybersecurity is orthogonal to any specific technology. As a consequence, although many people may be interested in knowing more about cybersecurity, approaching the topic is often perceived as cumbersome, if not even frustrating. In this context, serious gaming can be adopted to create an engaging and controlled environment where players with no security skills may face realistic challenges. Needless to say, designing and implementing such games is itself a challenge. In this chapter, we present our experience with designing and implementing a serious game on cybersecurity, called A NERD DOGMA. Briefly, A NERD DOGMA is a classical escape room adventure where players have to progressively advance by solving some challenges. What truly characterizes A NERD DOGMA is that all of the enigmas are actual cybersecurity challenges. Each challenge is based on a real security scenario where the player, being the attacker or the on-field agent, has to exfiltrate data, break ciphers, and intrude in remote systems. The main objective is to provide inexpert users with a first-hand experience of how certain security operations are planned and executed. To this aim, a number of issues must be addressed. For instance, one cannot avoid introducing security tools, e.g., to scan a remote machine programmatically. However, requiring players to interact with a command line terminal might discourage most of them. Another difficulty emerges from the integration of third-party technologies. Most games are self-contained, i.e., they do not allow participants to directly interact with external systems or resources, and, in case it is necessary, they mimic the external environment. Nevertheless, this approach is not optimal for cybersecurity where “thinking out of the box” is of paramount importance. Taking strategic design decisions requires a systematic assessment of these and other technical aspects that we present in this chapter."

                "In the last decade, there have been tremendous improvements in the IT field, and the demand for skilled professionals has ever since grown rapidly. For a better economic development, it is thus of primary importance for schools and universities to uncover and train new talents who will help propel our society’s upward trend in IT and meet the increasing demand. On the other hand, there is a misconception among youngsters that programming is complex and not designed for everyone. Using the fact that nowadays games are becoming increasingly popular especially among the younger generation, a mobile serious programming game, Code-Venture, is being proposed in this chapter. Other than being fun and entertaining, the aim of Code-Venture is to help the players understand the basics of coding and sharpen their skills in programming. Code-Venture is based on the fundamental programming principles as recommended in the ACM/IEEE <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> Curricula 2013. Moreover, through the implementation of the teacher’s application, which stores scoring information about the players of the game, a constant monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of the player’s performance can be performed. Pre-game and post-game surveys have been conducted to evaluate the mobile serious game Code-Venture. Most of the 35 respondents found the game useful and engaging with a considerable increase in the number of students who are willing to join a career in programming and another increase in the number of respondents who now found programming easy."

                "Sensemaking processes are regarded as a relevant conceptualization of how users interact with information visualizations. Nevertheless, there is little research about the specific sensemaking strategies users adopt when they work with visualizations. Psychological theories about human thinking and reasoning and theories from the area of graph comprehension are relevant approaches that should be taken into account when investigating sensemaking processes with information visualizations. In these areas, there is more detailed research about problem-solving strategies (e.g., in mathematical problem-solving) that could be relevant for information visualization. We provide an overview of interesting approaches and in which way they are relevant for interactions with visualizations. We describe an exploratory investigation with 18 <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> students performing a realistic task using a visual analytics system. The result of this investigation was a set of eleven sensemaking strategies. We discuss whether these strategies can be generalized across different visualizations and compare the results to results from other studies we have conducted in this area. We also present examples for recommendations based on such research."

                "Graph comprehension is the act of deriving meaning from graphs, an activity grounded in visuospatial reasoning that develops through a combination of instruction and practice. What we know about the mechanisms of graph comprehension stems from interleaving lines of inquiry in statistics, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, education, and psychology dating back to the 1980s. In this integrative review, I describe how models of graph comprehension evolved in response to developments in cognitive theory, offering a critical commentary on how foundational theories build upon each other, extending rather than replacing theoretical claims at different levels of analysis. I illuminate the landscape of contemporary research, before concluding with an argument for the role of visualization psychology in supporting theoretical integration across disciplinary boundaries."

                "Many organizations, including state administrations, define rules involving spatial knowledge. However, these rules are mainly specified and managed by hand using natural language. Advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> in knowledge management may improve such rule handling. Knowledge has to be built on recent, accurate, consistent and complete information-when possible-to allow decision-makers to take relevant actions. However, in many contexts, such as urban planning or emergency response support, information and rules are available from multiple stakeholders, which belong to different decision levels such as national, regional and local, thus highlighting several challenges. A first issue deals with modelling the rules by considering the hierarchy of decision levels, timeline of rules, etc. Next, acquiring knowledge from these stakeholders may lead to errors (e.g., partial rule extracted from a textual document, misinterpretation), inconsistencies or incompleteness (e.g., cases not covered by rules). Thus, a crucial step deals with the detection of relationships between rules (e.g., equivalence, causality) to facilitate the application of all rules. Lastly, integrating heterogeneous data, on which rules can be applied, is a well-studied problem which becomes more complex due to data provided at different levels of details. In this article, we study how GIS cope with these challenges to manage rule-based knowledge at different levels, and we illustrate them on the COVID-19 pandemic."

                "Ethics concerns have been present in the early stages of <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> (CS) history, which straightforwardly reflects in the educational process of all subjacent areas. With the popularization of software applications and its pervasiveness in modern society, the worries about ethical risks associated with software products have grown and became an integral part of the Software Engineering process, which includes the Human-<em>Computer</em> Interaction (HCI) issues. HCI deals with the most visible software’s layers and with higher potential impact on final users, but often relegated to a second plane in syllabi of <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>-related courses. In this context, the present paper brings a discussion on some of ethical risks related to HCI, based on a narrative literature review about different pitfalls in the interaction design that could have ethical impacts, aiming to help teachers to plan HCI-related curricula, syllabi, and lesson plans."

                "Cross-validation (CV) has been widely used in GeoAI research to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. Often, a labeled data set is randomly split into training and validation data, and a machine learning model is trained on the training data and then evaluated on the validation data in an iterative manner. Such a random CV approach could lead to an overestimate of model performance on geographic data, due to the common existence of spatial autocorrelation. Random CV can generate many training and validation data instances that are spatially close, and a model trained on such training data can be considered as having already “peeked” into the nearby validation data, given their spatial closeness and likely attribute similarity. Spatial CV can help address this issue by splitting the data spatially rather than randomly, thereby increasing the independence between the training and validation data. While a number of spatial CV methods have been developed, they are scattered in the literature across multiple disciplines, including ecology, remote sensing, GIScience, and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. This chapter discusses four main spatial CV methods identified from the multidisciplinary literature, and uses two examples based on real-world data to demonstrate these methods in comparison with random CV."

                "The development of digital image processing, as a subset of digital signal processing, depended upon the maturity of photography and image <em>science</em>, introduction of <em>computers</em>, discovery and advancement of digital recording devices, and the capture of digital images. In addition, government and industry applications in the Earth and medical <em>sciences</em> were paramount to the growth of the technology. From the early days when photography was first introduced to <em>science</em> to today, artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies have been intensively used to analyze imagery. Spatial image processing has experienced breakthroughs and evolutions. This chapter presents an overview of the history of image processing, GeoAI-based image processing applications, and the role of GeoAI in advancing image processing methods and research. We also discussed the remaining challenges to using GeoAI for image processing regarding training data annotation, the issues of scale, resolution, and change in space over time."

                "Artificial intelligence (AI), along with its subfields of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), allows computational models to process and learn the data representations with various levels of abstraction. AI models are widely used in finance, healthcare, technology, business, banking, <em>science</em>, and agriculture. In agriculture, utilizing ample human resources at each stage of cultivation and challenging tasks involved in predicting diseases and other factors using traditional methods is ineffective and expensive. Potato (Solanum Tuberosum) is a highly consumed and cultivated vegetable crop across the globe. The potato crop yield is highly affected by the fungal pathogens which cause leaf diseases: Early Blight (EB) and Late Blight (LB). Early detection of fungal pathogens in the crop can reduce yield loss. To detect the fungal pathogens in the plants, a continuous monitoring system in the field must be established. <em>Computer</em> vision and artificial intelligence can help farmers monitor plant diseases at every stage. Their application in monitoring the diseased leaves of the crop and predicting the diseases correctly has received great attention from researchers. This chapter deals with applying a nature-inspired Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) in optimizing the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) performance in classifying the EB and LB diseases in potato leaves."

                "Purpose and objectives of the article. To substantiate the unified methodology of teaching the discipline of educational components to applicants of the second (master’s) level of higher education of the educational program “<em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>” of the field of knowledge 12 Information Technologies of the specialty 122 <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> of full-time and part-time forms of study. To achieve this goal, the following tasks are set: 1. Analyze the current state of research and publications; 2. To substantiate the unified methodology of teaching the discipline of educational components to applicants of the second (mas-ter’s) level of higher education of the educational program “<em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>” of the field of knowledge 12 Information Technologies of the specialty 122 <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> of full-time and part-time forms of education on the basis of a <em>computer</em> game. Research result. The unified methodology of teaching the discipline of educational components to applicants of the second (master’s) level of higher education of the educational program “<em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>” of the field of knowledge 12 Information Technologies of the specialty 122 <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> of full-time and part-time forms of education on the basis of the teacher’s game is justified. Through the application of the reverse transformation of a student into a teacher, the educational and developmental goal of students acquiring pri-mary educational quasi-professional teaching experience has been achieved. The scientific novelty lies in the fact that the first developed a unified methodology for teaching the discipline of educational components to applicants of the second (master’s) level of higher education of the educational program “<em>computer</em> <em>science</em>” on the basis of a game (gamified) approach interested in acquiring educational quasi-professional experience in teaching. Thus, the method proposed by the authors for teaching educational disciplines of educational components to students of the second (master’s) level of higher education of the educational program “<em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>” of the field of knowledge 12 Information Technologies of the specialty 122 <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> provides a practical implementation of the theory of “anticipatory learning”. As a result of its application, a large reserve of time budget allocated for independent work will allow students to deeply study the educational material, prepare for a lecture class and, as a final result, acquire educational quasi-professional experience for future activities. In the case of applying the methodology based on gamification, it allows to create such an informational and educational environment that contributes to the independent, active pursuit of higher education students to acquire knowledge, professional skills and abilities, such as critical thinking, the ability to make managerial (managerial) decisions, work in a team, be ready to cooperate; helps reveal abilities and motivates self-education. The methodology reveals excellent properties in the case of a mixed application of distance education and advance training, which will not only ensure the implementation of the curriculum for mastering the educational component, but also provide maximum opportunities for students to preserve life and health in war conditions."

                "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a sophisticated software-based technology that combines complex <em>computer</em> programming with aspects of human intelligence in a variety of ways to do a wide range of tasks that were previously thought to be only humanly feasible. The invention of electronic <em>computers</em> with stored programs gave rise to the idea of AI. At a meeting held at Dartmouth College in 1956, <em>computer</em> scientist John McCarthy first used the phrase \"Artificial Intelligence\". A branch of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> that has grown over time is AI. It involves replicating human cognitive processes using machines, notably <em>computer</em> systems. The phrase \"artificial intelligence\" (AI) is frequently used to describe a project that aims to create systems that are capable of doing activities that typically require human intelligence, such as decision-making, visual perception, language comprehension, and speech recognition. AI systems routinely operate by consuming vast amounts of trained and labeled data, scanning it for correlations and patterns, and then using those patterns to predict future events. AI is concerned with the development and use of <em>computer</em> systems that can solve issues that often call for human intelligence. Such issues are related to jobs that are naturally occurring, such as eyesight or natural language interpretation, or both. Typically, they cannot be resolved using traditional algorithmic techniques. AI systems handle symbolic information rather than only numerical data, as is customary in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, to solve them. AI uses several different types of knowledge about an application area. Therefore, important to AI research and development are the issues of knowledge representation, acquisition, and usage. One of the most active subfields is the deployment of knowledge-based systems."

                "Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), has transformed biological applications. In biological <em>science</em>, ML-based algorithms have also successfully handled large amounts of data. The use of ML-based AI approaches has switched applications from generalization to customization. Some recent trends in ML-/AI-based systems include recommendation systems, healthcare chatbots, and precision medicine, and achieving computational speed is always a challenge in such instances. The ML model training can be accelerated using quantum computing (QC), and more effective algorithms can be produced. QC can create an AI system that is optimized and capable of quickly finishing years of analysis. Theoretically, quantum <em>computers</em> could indeed efficiently simulate the entire problem, including interactions at the atomic level. Additionally, algorithmic advancements in quantum machine learning (QML) provide intriguing alternatives to traditional ML strategies that might be beneficial for the biochemical activities associated with the initial stages of drug discovery. Likewise, quantum hardware is also rapidly evolving to the point where perfect simulations are challenging to achieve even with the world’s most powerful supercomputers. This chapter will cover the classical machine learning techniques as well as the core concepts of quantum computing with respect to ML and DL. It will discuss the applications of quantum computing with respect to biological applications such as drug discovery, protein function prediction, and predicting interactions between drugs and targets. The chapter also includes several open-source tools which can be employed for quantum computing in different biological applications. It will also discuss various challenges related to quantum computing and its future prospects while dealing with complex biological problems."

                "Nowadays algorithms play an important role in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> as well as in biology; they ensure that the work is done by the <em>computer</em> in the most efficient way. It means that it takes less time, less storage as well as less cost. Prior to the design of efficient algorithms in computational biology, the problems were not able to be solved in a reasonable time. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the basics of algorithms and their primary applications in computational biology. The chapters further to this introductory chapter on algorithms will describe all the basic to advanced-level algorithms available for computational biology and bioinformatics. Here we will be getting familiar with what is an algorithm, the analysis of algorithms, different categories in the analysis of an algorithm, what are the time and space complexities of the algorithms, and solving problems through the classification of algorithms that is basically divided into two types which are parallel and sequential algorithms. Then we will be looking over the design methods of parallel algorithms where we will be learning about different types of algorithms used like divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy approach and many more with their advantages, disadvantages and applications. Finally, we come to the part which explains the use of design and analysis of algorithms in computational biology where we have taken examples of algorithms like clustering, classification and heuristic algorithms."

                "Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates the knowledge of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, mathematics, and physics into biology. Automated methods for genome sequencing, genome comparisons, gene expression analysis, and derivation of metabolic and regulatory pathways have helped extensively in pharmaceutical research. Industrial and biopharmaceutical research in bioinformatics has been in focus for developing newer microbial strains, drugs, and vaccines that lead to personalized and precision medicine. This chapter thus aims to provide insights into the role of industrial and biopharmaceutical research in bioinformatics. Industrial research in bioinformatics led to discovery and identification of new biocatalysts, rational directed evolution, prediction of chemical toxicity, and pathways for biodegradation. Synthetic biology and system biology approaches provide engineered industrial strains for production of biofuels, commodity chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Biopharmaceutical research in bioinformatics finds application in health care, drug innovation, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disorders. The development of next-generation biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars provides market for newer biopharmaceutical medicines. The clinical trials being carried out with newly designed drugs generate genomic data can be analyzed for improvement of drugs by pharmaceutical companies. The availability of big data and its analysis using artificial intelligence–/machine learning–based tools further increase the scope of bioinformatic analyses."

                "Objective This chapter is a retrospective overview of research in the area of sentiment analysis of social media. The research is undertaken using bibliometric analysis. The purpose of this study is to conduct <em>science</em> mapping and themes of the existing work to find the gaps and direction for future research in the subject area of sentiment analysis and social media. Methodology approach A bibliometric analysis of the articles published in the area of sentiment analysis of social media is conducted using Scopus analysis, Biblioshiny, and VOSviewer. A total of 1123 documents were extracted from the Scopus dataset for the time-span of 20 years (2002-2022) on 27 December 2022. The study covers Citation Analysis, Author Analysis, Document Analysis, Source Analysis to better understand the roadmap of research in the subject area and the future trends. Findings Bibliometric tools are used to identify past, current, and future trends, leading sources of publication, authors, articles, and significant keywords followed by comprehensive <em>science</em> mapping analysis. The top nine significant journals in the subject area are identified and ranked on the basis of CiteScore: SNIP and SJR. Finally, the study highlights the gap areas, which will shape the future course of research. Research limitations/implications The study focuses on the literature extracted from Scopus dataset; however, the authors feel that future researchers may also target Web of <em>Science</em>, Google Scholar, or a combination of different datasets. Also, this study on sentiment analysis of social media is limited only to the field of <em>Computer</em> <em>Sciences</em> additional subject areas may be included to widen the scope of research. Originality/value This study of “Sentiment Analysis of Social Media- Bibliometric Analysis” is the original work in this subject area. It provides an extensive indication of origins in the area of sentiment analysis of social media. Paper type: Review paper."

                "With the development of technology, every industry has partnered with blockchain to deliver the greatest results, including healthcare, education, and finance. However, one of the most crucial sectors, namely, forensic <em>sciences</em>, is still behind. Web data is important in hostage cybercrimes because it is used to link people to illicit tasks. As a result, it is essential to safeguard the validity and veracity of evidence at the scene as it passes through the various levels of the custody chain throughout an online inquiry into the scene of the crime. With the aid of blockchain technology, intellectual custody analysis can become more dependable and durable. As <em>computer</em>-based evidence progresses through the various phases of the investigation process, its security and source must be preserved. In this instance, it comprises a particular chain of forensics in which pathology personnel, forensic staff, physicians, and police officers pass received medical reports through the various phases. Forensic evidence examination in the lab necessitates knowledge and medical skill to gather data regarding an innocent person’s death or any physical injury. Digital forensics will be more secure, and the investigation will be more transparent to people on the other side of the jurisdictional border thanks to blockchain technology."

                "Remote sensing is a <em>science</em> and art of acquiring and measuring information about Earth surface objects and phenomena without actually being in contact with it. With technological advancements and rising environmental concern, the use of remote sensing in monitoring dynamic and complex environmental systems have grown exponentially in recent years. These remote sensing systems generate vast amounts of data that is difficult to manage and store. Processing of such “big data” possess a challenge for the researchers and scientists. In order to efficiently process obtained satellite data and provide accurate outputs, the introduction of machine learning in the field of remote sensing has shown to be of significant use in recent years. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides <em>computers</em> to learn without being programmed. It is regarded as a workhorse in the era of so-called “big data”. This chapter will focus on applied perspective of machine learning with an emphasis on algorithms that are actively used in the field of remote sensing such as support vector machines, single decision trees (DTs), random forests, boosted DTs, artificial neural networks, and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)."

                "While the <em>science</em> around Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen substantial progress in recent years, its broad application to healthcare use cases has proven more difficult. This chapter presents an overview of the current state of AI in healthcare. The process of the healthcare AI model development is reviewed, and placed into the critical context of real-world data quality, bias, and algorithmic limitations. Advances in radiomics and <em>computer</em> vision have led to great success in deployed medical device software that use AI to assist in radiological workflows or for screening and diagnosis. Clinical decision support embedded with electronic health records that can risk stratify patients in real time, and the natural language processing models with the ability to extract meaning from narrative clinical notes, are placing AI in active, high-value use-cases at the forefront of clinical care. The future is bright, but advances in healthcare data and implementation infrastructure are required to fulfil the potential of healthcare AI."

                "Modern research in space <em>science</em> is accumulating an exponentially growing amount of data. The size of the datasets produced by simulations has grown in time with the speed of the <em>computers</em>, following its own Moore’s law. At the same time, also data from space mission has grown, with more images, more time series and more complex datasets such as spectrograms and velocity distribution function. Mining information and making discoveries out of this wealth of data has far transcended the ability of the human mind. Artificial intelligence (AI), instead, has taken off in many areas of research and applications. Space <em>science</em> can benefit from this new trend. We report here on the recent developments on the application of AI to the analysis of space data. Without limiting ourselves to it, we focus especially on the work done in the context of the AIDA Horizon 2020 project (Artificial Intelligence for Data Analysis, www.aida-space.eu). We show how AI developments are transforming the way we analyze space data. In particular, we find promise in unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) to give optimism for fundamental new discoveries. Supervised ML can expand the range of known methods of analysis, learning from human training and treat vast amount of data. But unsupervised ML, a method where the learning is not guided by previous knowledge, can truly find unexpected new discoveries. Unsupervised ML provides techniques to treat large data sets and discover within them features, correlations and physical laws that would escape traditional approaches. In this chapter we review some of the applications of unsupervised ML developed by AIDA."

                "The growing popularity of automated decision systems is based on recent advances in an area of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> that is described by the enigmatic term artificial intelligence (AI). While the technology has come a long way since its origins in the 1950s, little progress has been made on terminological clarity. This chapter traces the development of the technology and decribes the basic processes behind AI. It explains why AI is not a helpful term from a regulatory perspective and suggests placing the problematic act of decision-making at the center of the further analysis."

                "Brain-<em>Computer</em> Interfaces (BCIs) are a cutting-edge technology that allows for direct brain and external device communication, such as a <em>computer</em>. BCIs use advanced neuroscience techniques to measure and interpret brain activity, making it possible for users to control devices and software with their thoughts alone. This emerging technology has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare to gaming to military operations. However, the development of BCIs also raises ethical concerns, such as privacy invasion, loss of autonomy, and human enhancement. As the race to merge minds and machines continues, it is crucial for researchers, policymakers, and society as a whole to consider the implications of this technology and ensure that it is developed and used responsibly. BCIs have various applications, such as restoring lost functions, augmenting existing abilities, or creating new experiences. BCIs also pose various challenges and risks, such as ethical, social, and security issues. This study gives a comprehensive overview of the history, <em>science</em>, technology, and ethics of BCIs. It also discusses the current state and prospects of BCIs, as well as their potential impact on society and humanity. This study is intended for anyone interested in learning more about BCIs and their implications."

                "For many decades, mainstream artificial intelligence (AI) refused to believe that deep learning with neural networks and backpropagation offer true brain-like general intelligence, despite numerous successes on tough engineering problems and mathematical advances. The tide changed in 2009 due to a $2 million NSF grant to Ng and LeCun which I signed off on, despite fierce objections which in today's US government environment would have prevented the action. Empirical success on well-known challenge problems led to follow-ons by DARPA, then by Google, and then a flood of interest by competitors trying to keep up. There are huge investments pursuing new applications of methods known and proven before 1990, but also a huge reservoir of more powerful methods proven out in engineering which have yet to be exploited in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, including mathematical principles which (along with related physics) begin to give us a real functional understanding of how the human brain and mind achieve their intelligence. The “Terminator” risk with AI is very serious, but as the Internet of Things (IoT) takes over the world, the risks of artificial stupidity (AS) are just as serious. There is an urgent need for us to develop new interfaces and integrated platforms, using more powerful AI in a human-friendly way along with more advanced unbreakable operating systems, quantum technology, and systems to fully support the deepest human potential. If we do not move quickly and effectively enough to develop more benign possibilities, the survival of humanity is at stake (see www.werbos.com/IT_big_picture.pdf)."

                "The production of agricultural products is essential to human survival. Agricultural goods are vital to food security and economic development, despite being susceptible to numerous bacterial, viral, and fungal diseases. Apple disease and insect infestation are the main causes of reduced fruit yield. Apples share both characteristics. As a result of low apple production, the apple industry loses money every year. Rare plant diseases are diagnosed by botanists and other agricultural specialists, resulting in excessive pesticide use. Early detection of apple diseases can help reduce the spread of diseases, enhance productivity, and eventually eliminate them. Several factors can make diagnosing and identifying early illness difficult, including the presence of several symptoms on a single leaf. These factors include an uneven backdrop, leaf color changes caused by infected cells’ age, and the size of disease spots. Using machine learning algorithms and sophisticated machine learning techniques, this study constructs a robust model for accurate diagnosis and classification of apple leaf disease. Plant loss will be reduced and detection accuracy will be improved. For detecting objects and diagnosing apple leaf disease, GLCM, SVM, and deep learning algorithms are recommended. As a result, early detection and accurate diagnosis will be possible. In the future, the system may be able to diagnose leaf diseases in many plants in real time. Consequently, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and agriculture will become more accurate and reliable, as apple tree diseases, black rot, fish scale disease, and snow apple rust are being investigated."

                "Botswana, a stable sub-Saharan democratic nation of approximately 2.4 million people, got its independence in 1966. Although originally poor, the nation is now considered upper-middle-income. National healthcare expenditure is relatively high, with reasonably developed universal healthcare, and most people live well within reach of a health facility. Notwithstanding Botswana’s progress, a recent United Nations report suggests that the nation has “fallen below expectations,” in part due to an ongoing battle with high rates of HIV/AIDS and noncommunicable diseases and a shortage of rehabilitation services and professionals.Globally, people live longer and thus more live with disability; Botswana has been similarly affected. The increased prevalence of disabilities is due both to communicable and noncommunicable diseases, with the greatest contributors toward disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) being mental disorders (13.7%), HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (13%), musculoskeletal disorders (9.9%), neurological disorders (8.0%), and sense organ diseases (6.2%).During a recent survey of Botswana’s rehabilitation professionals, lack of recognition by the government, severe staff shortage, poor reimbursement by insurers, and absence of local rehabilitation equipment manufacturing were identified as some of the key challenges in rehabilitation. A need for improvement in rehabilitation services and capacity has been proposed, with government prioritization of rehabilitation through increased funding, staff training, better facilities, and the promotion and support of local manufacturing.Multidisciplinary research innovation among engineering, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, rehabilitation, medicine, neuropsychology, and others will be essential for advancing robotics and other technology-driven approaches to rehabilitation, especially for patients with cognitive and motor deficits due to HIV, stroke, and other diseases. Leveraging years of a fruitful partnership between the government of Botswana, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Botswana have recently established a multidisciplinary laboratory to develop affordable rehabilitation robotics, prosthetics, and other technologies, while building capacity among faculty and students."

                "This paper summarizes both the author's views as panelist and chair and the views of other panelists expressed during presentations and discussions in connection with the Industrial Supercomputing Session convened at the second Frontiers of Supercomputing conference. The other panel members were Patric Savage, Senior Research Fellow, <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> Department, Shell Development Company; Howard E. Simmons, Vice President and Senior Advisor, du Pont Company; Myron Ginsberg, Consultant Systems Engineer, EDS Advanced Computing Center, General Motors Corporation; and Robert Hermann, Vice President for <em>Science</em> and Technology, United Technologies Corporation. Included in these remarks is an overview of the basic issues related to high-performance computing needs of private-sector industrial users. Discussions that ensued following the presentations of individual panel members focused on supercomputing questions from an industrial perspective in areas that include cultural issues and problems, support issues, efficiency versus ease of use, technology transfer, impediments to broader use, encouraging industrial use, and industrial grand challenges."

                "It is a widespread opinion that knowledge management (KM) is a strongly interdisciplinary field of study. Over the years, this characteristic has become more marked, and it is now possible to identify more than one hundred different definitions of the term coming from distinct subject areas, e.g., business management, accounting, education, human resources, information, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, healthcare, and library <em>science</em>. The number of papers related to KM has grown notably, and they now amount to tens of thousands. Looking at the literature, KM appears to be a pervasive concept that can be applied to any human activity, and conversely, any dimension related to human activity affects the adoption of KM. Although multidiscipinarity is not necessrily a negative characteristic, there is a risk that the concept itself of KM becomes misunderstood or used in a generic way and may lose its original significance. In other words, the proliferation of works that refer to KM is a positive signal but also raises the question of whether the discipline is consolidating or diluting its identity. The paper stimulates a discussion on this by going a little deeper into the abovementioned pervasiveness. An analysis of various reviews of the literature on KM is done to verify if KM is conceptualized and applied in a common way or if it is splitting into different but increasingly inconsistent streams."

                "This paper describes the methodology followed and the lessons learned from employing crowdsourcing techniques as part of a homework assignment involving higher education students of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. Making use of a platform that supports crowdsourcing in the cultural heritage domain students were solicited to enrich the metadata associated with a selection of music tracks. The results of the campaign were further analyzed and exploited by students through the use of semantic web technologies. In total, 98 students participated in the campaign, contributing more than 6400 annotations concerning 854 tracks. The process also led to the creation of an openly available annotated dataset, which can be useful for machine learning models for music tagging. The campaign’s results and the comments gathered through an online survey enable us to draw some useful insights about the benefits and challenges of integrating crowdsourcing into <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> curricula and how this can enhance students’ engagement in the learning process."

                "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education has the potential to transform the way we learn and teach. In this paper, we examine the current state of AI in education and explore the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating this technology into the classroom. The approaches currently available for AI education often present students with experiences only focusing on discrete <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> concepts agnostic to a larger curriculum. However, teaching AI must not be siloed or interdisciplinary. Rather, AI instruction ought to be transdisciplinary, including connections to the broad curriculum and community in which students are learning. This paper delves into the AI program currently in development for Neom Community School and the larger Education, Research, and Innovation Sector in Neom, Saudi Arabia’s new megacity under development. In this program, AI is both taught as a subject and to learn other subjects within the curriculum through the school system’s International Baccalaureate (IB) approach, which deploys learning through “Units of Inquiry.” This approach to education connects subjects across a curriculum under one major guiding question at a time. The proposed method offers a meaningful approach to introducing AI to students throughout these Units of Inquiry, as it shifts AI from a subject that students “like” or “not like” to a subject that is taught throughout the curriculum."

                "Digital pathology (DP) involves digitizing histopathology slides to generate whole slide images (WSI) and the subsequent analysis of these WSIs using various computational methods. In the 1950s McCarthy et al. coined the term “artificial intelligence (AI)” for the branch of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> which uses machine-based approaches to arrive at certain predictions, thereby mimicking human intelligence while solving complex problems. The last decade has witnessed a promising increase in the application of AI tools in anatomic pathology. Using AI, DP can potentially revolutionize the practice of anatomic pathology as not only does it transfer an image from the glass slide to the monitor but so does it augment the pathologist’s eye with information that is impossible to be gleaned by human examination. Machine learning-based approaches are based on the machine “learning” to make predictions based on the input data and algorithms and falls within the broad ambit of AI. The applications of AI are myriad and range from objective diagnosis, quality control, cancer predication/prognostication, tumor grading, education, and research. In this chapter, we highlight the use of AI in anatomic pathology with emphasis on future directions."

                "With the profound progress in machine learning and deep learning methodologies the field of surgical data <em>science</em> has burgeoned over the last decade. To date, many proof-of-concept algorithms have emerged, capable of performing a variety of tasks. One area that is unique to surgical AI is in <em>computer</em> vision, which strives to understand images and videos from pixels to characterize anatomical structures, surgical tools, and surgical phases and, ultimately, provide surgical teams with decision support. Artificial intelligence applications have a useful role in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of care and have also had encouraging results in surgical education and robotic surgery. However, it is important to note that very few applications have made it to the patient’s bedside, and most are still in the preclinical phase with considerable obstacles that need to be overcome prior to implementation."

                "Recent technological developments have made it easier for teaching and learning to transform. In today's interconnected world, there are no longer any physical restrictions on receiving an education by enrolling in a school. Thousands of courses are presently offered online that don’t require formal attendance. As a result, this “open learning” paradigm is a leader in cutting-edge research in many fields. <em>Computer</em> <em>science</em> is one subject area where the benefits of open learning may be demonstrated. As a primary paradigm for problem-solving and information collecting in online learning, crowdsourced programs like Stack Overflow, Wikipedia, and CourseEra have arisen. These programs give a lot of benefits to its users, such as the ability to quickly respond to questions about programming and to contribute and express one's own thoughts. They still have a number of shortcomings, though. For instance, it was thought that Stack Overflow was not a good application for beginning programmers. Therefore, proper in-depth study is required to improve the education sector using crowdsourcing and crowdfunding."

                "Artificial neural networks are algorithms that are made possible by artificial intelligence that model the composition and operation of the human brain. Artificial intelligence applications such as <em>computer</em> vision, autonomous vehicles, automatic text generation, face recognition (e.g., using facial recognition on an iPhone as a digital password), and others are increasingly using machine learning and deep learning. In circumstances requiring <em>computer</em> vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, applications using AI are significantly faster to use. This chapter’s goal is to pinpoint the elements that can enhance the use of artificial intelligence in the industrial sector. To operationalize this research, a scoping review was performed, and the main conclusions AI can improve quality of life, particularly in the field of the life <em>sciences</em>, and reshape all types of industry and services, leading to a new model of work and productivity."

                "The progress of <em>science</em> in the last few years in areas such as <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, information technology, electrical engineering, mechatronics, and artificial intelligence has enabled the development of increasingly sophisticated robotic systems. Medical robotics is still a relatively new field of research, and many institutes and companies that are involved in it are striving to adopt different styles and techniques to handle different medical procedures. Mobile robots are applied in many medical fields, which include performing sensitive surgeries, replacing limbs, rehabilitation therapy, visiting patients, serving patients with food and medicines, remote treatment of patients, remote monitoring of surgical procedures in medical institutions, disinfection of surgical rooms, etc. In robotics, artificial intelligence application is important for planning and developing robots that have a sense of self-awareness, thus enabling robot-environment interactions. This feature, known as social robotics, is important from the social viewpoint, and it encompasses two broad domains: human-robot interactions and cognitive robotics. In recent years, artificial intelligence has been entering medical institutions, and the best example is its application in diagnosing diseases. This chapter deals with the classification of service robots, their development, and their distribution in the last 10 years, especially their application for helping and performing various tasks in medicine, and the application of artificial intelligence in medicine."

                "In this chapter, we examine how human-<em>computer</em> interaction (HCI) and sentiment analysis research can create more user-centered systems. We define HCI and sentiment analysis and explore their symbiotic relationship. By acknowledging the emotional nature of human users, we discuss the importance of emotionally intelligent interfaces in enhancing user experiences and promoting user retention. Drawing on interdisciplinary knowledge from machine learning, psychology, and cognitive <em>science</em>, we propose affective systems capable of adapting to users' emotional states. We outline the challenges of incorporating emotional intelligence, with an emphasis on emotion detection and expressiveness. We present Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) as an example of sentiment-aware systems that facilitate human-like interactions. Utilizing Maslow's hierarchy, we emphasize the significance of recognizing and prioritizing user needs, and propose essential properties for effective conversational agents. Lastly, we suggest methods for multimodal sentiment detection and conclude the chapter with future research directions and ethical considerations."

                "Artificial intelligence as a tool has been used in various disciplines. This chapter discusses the application of human–<em>computer</em> interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI) in psychology. Moreover, the chapter discusses how new technologies are assisting the discipline of psychology and how it creates cyberspace that affects behavior, develops negative relationships, and promotes fear of missing out, among other things. Also, it covers AI and Human rights, i.e., how AI affects humans and vice versa. Further is discussed how AI and HCI can be coupled together and make better user-centered designs using rationalistic, design, and cognitive engineering approaches. To produce better user-friendly products, the chapter also focuses on usability engineering and verification discipline dealing with human <em>computer</em> interfaces and AI including psychology, human factors, and cognitive <em>science</em>. Additionally, it is discussed how the Google homepage has varied over time, with minor tweaks to make it more interactive. In the last section, the whole chapter is summarized, and the future scope of democratization and decentralization of information technology is discussed. Moreover, we have also addressed how social media including Web 2.0 shapes our behavior and outlook of how we perceive the world in general."

                "A mandatory requirement for all people who want to go into the STEAM field (<em>science</em>, technology, engineering, arts and math) is to have developed levels of spatial skills because these skills allow the adequate performance of students, especially in the first year of university studies. One hundred years of studies of these skills have shown that it is possible to train them, and countless forms of training have been developed. However, new technologies and human–<em>computer</em> interaction are proving to be more effective. We will show in this chapter the effectiveness of two short training courses using augmented reality and immersive virtual reality in engineering and architecture students from two universities in different countries. For the measurement of these skills, we considered three subcomponents measured with the Mental Rotation Test (MRT) for the mental rotations component, the Differential Aptitude Test (DAT5-SR) for the spatial visualization component, and Spatial Orientation Test (SOT) for the spatial orientation component. The data obtained from experimental and control groups were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric tests: one-factor ANOVA, Student’s t test, and Kruskal–Wallis. We conclude that augmented reality and immersive virtual reality are very effective as short spatial skills training in engineering and architecture students."

                "The supersized potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in all spheres of technology, business, and day-to-day life has helped to change the ways we are doing things at a meteoric pace. Although our prime focus is on the development and optimization of learning algorithms to augment AI performance, the need for including humans in the AI loop cannot be underestimated. The paradigm of human-centered artificial intelligence (HAI) incorporates the AI-based hardware and software systems that are improving progressively because of inputs provided by humans. The gap between machines and humans can be bridged by introducing robotic intelligence having the goal of understanding human language, emotion, and behavior. For a successful HAI, we require solving a lot of aspects of human–robot interactions. There are giant subfields that are required to work together in the HAI such as the differentiation between the complex biologic brain and the electrical brain derived from neuroscience advancements, sociology, psychology, and the mathematical modeling of the behavior of the brain using game theory. The success of HAI also depends on extracting human behavior from ergonomics, from <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> using natural language processing, machine learning algorithms, and finally building the hardware using these things using the branch of robotics."

                "Metaverse is designed as a time and space-independent environment where virtual and reality will be intertwined, real-time and multi-user, human–<em>computer</em>–robot interactions will be possible. Metaverse design needs to be handled together with the internet, social networks, <em>computer</em> games, virtual reality glasses, augmented reality software, the internet of things, wearable devices, 5G/6G internet infrastructure, cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, and robotics technologies. The Metaverse in design is a concept that covers every field, from education to art, from commerce to health, and from games to entertainment. Platforms, where many people of different languages, religions, races, and ages can interact simultaneously with avatars, AR/VR, smart devices, and wearables, have the potential to generate enormous amounts of data. The analysis of this produced data with advanced artificial intelligence techniques has critical importance in terms of both the ecosystem’s continuity and the user experience’s improvement. Artificial intelligence and robotic technologies act as a bridge between the real and virtual worlds in Metaverse platforms. To provide communication between human–avatar, avatar–avatar, human–robot, and robot–avatar, natural language recognition, voice recognition, voice-to-text conversion, and text-to-speech conversion tasks can be performed with artificial intelligence technologies. Metaverse platforms, where individuals in the real world can control their avatars or robots in the virtual world with various hardware, communicate with others, and produce rich digital content, also promise to make their economies. However, such a Metaverse ecosystem has not been created, as the necessary technology and infrastructure are not yet available. In addition, the hardware required for users to enter these Metaverse platforms is limited in number, quite expensive, cumbersome, and unsuitable for long-term use. For this reason, technology companies and social media giants are investing heavily to create their Metaverse ecosystems. Therefore, the future of the internet is shaped in parallel with the development of infrastructure and technology."

                "In recent years, the use and popularity of virtual environments and 3D virtual games in education have been increasing. In addition, virtual environments where people can meet and shop have started to be preferred day by day. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis has brought some changes in the education system. The environments in which teaching takes place have rapidly changed to cover a broad audience. In this case, different situations arise in the design process of the virtual learning environment made in the Metaverse environment. In this chapter, a systematic and bibliometric analysis of the concept of the Metaverse and the gamification applications created in virtual world environments associated with this concept in virtual environment design has been carried out. In this study, a systematic review of the use of Metaverse environments as an educational environment, the preferred techniques, and the criteria considered was carried out and was completed in seven stages. PRISMA guidelines were used as the reporting method. Within the scope of the research, only applied research is carried out in the field of education, including the concepts of “Virtual World”, “Second Life”, “Multi-user virtual environments (MUVE)”, and “Social MUVE”, in the databases of ERIC, Web of <em>Science</em>, Tr Index for the years 2010–2022 were included. In the first stage, 342 studies were accessed, and 52 studies that met the selection criteria were included in the analysis. The articles were examined in the context of the title, abstract, keyword, method, type of application used, application area, and findings. In this context, the literature was reviewed, the studies in the last 10 years were examined, and the historical development of the Metaverse, its applications in education, and suggestions for future studies were presented."

                "In the subject of aerospace health informatics practice, the concept of health informatics and theory of information systems are the underlying foundation for its core competency practice. Conceptually, the core competency of health informatics is critical in developing the skills and specialities that recognise the depth of expertise and knowledge in digital health. To date, scholarly research within the health informatics core competency remains of unique discussions in the line work of health professionals, owing to the field that are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. Therefore, in understanding the advances of its core competency, underlying theory necessitating pursuing multifaceted fields can only be resolved from the vantage point of transdisciplinarity. Theoretically, health informatics is seen as a transdisciplinary within the information systems field that integrates the <em>computer</em> <em>sciences</em> and its informatics principles within health and medical <em>sciences</em> in a digital health context and transcends their traditional boundaries. The latest general health informatics competency evaluation was established in February 2022 by the distinguished body of digital health in Australia; the Australasian Institute of Digital Health (AIDH). This AIDH health informatics new competency framework encompasses the dynamic nature of digital health and the challenges and opportunities it presents. Since the health informatics competency does not have a unitary framework in terms of a uniform set of concepts and theories, which represents multiple, diverse research directions and thus various inquiry approaches that consist of its factors: concept and its theory, exploratory, empirical, and the future point of view. On that account, availing oneself of the AIDH health informatics new competency framework, this chapter aimed to explore the competency by utilising the grounded theory to elaborate potential factors between the general medicine <em>science</em> and the aerospace medicine, which departing from what the general medicine <em>science</em> is primarily concerned. This chapter provides an important perspective of its conceptual and theoretical that empirical examines the relationship between the former and latter that determines the aerospace health informatics core competency from information systems’ theory angle. The applicable potential competencies in relation to the aerospace health informatics from this chapter describes an illustration of the abovementioned relationship toward its core competency standpoint of the potential future aerospace health informatics practice."

                "On October 28, 2021, with the old name Facebook, now known as Meta, introduced the research areas that Meta company targeted and decided to direct its investment, and with a more radical decision to change the name of the company in this direction [1], the concept of Metaverse made a great impression on both the media and researchers and has garnered some attention. Today, we define Metaverse as an immersive platform that we can access with augmented or virtual reality, interact with any medium using permanent avatars and innovative digital technology. But the truth is that Metaverse is not a new term. This word was first used in 1992 in the <em>science</em> fiction novel Snow Crash written by Neal Stephenson, similar to its current definition. Although there is no universally accepted definition of the concept of Metaverse, like every cumulatively advancing <em>science</em>, has historically experienced a lot since it was first introduced in 1992 and has been published in many movies and books until today and has been the subject of news and scientific research. Looking back to understand where all these developments will lead in future and contextualizing the important steps we have taken on the way to the Metaverse as humanity will be very eye-opening for the future. For this reason, the article examines the 40-year historical development, milestones, and etymological origins of Metaverse, which has now started to gain a technological and scientific infrastructure, out of <em>science</em> fiction, and sheds light on the past and future of Metaverse."

                "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> that uses raw time-series data information from embedded smartphone sensors and wearable devices to infer human actions. It has aroused considerable interest in various smart home contexts, particularly for constantly monitoring human behavior in an ecologically friendly atmosphere for elderly people and rehabilitation. Data collection, feature extraction from noise and distortion, feature selection, and pre-processing and categorization are among the operating components of a typical HAR system. Extraction of feature and selection strategies have recently been developed using cutting-edge approaches and traditional machine learning classifiers. The majority of the solutions, on the other hand, rely on simple feature extraction algorithms that are unable to detect complex behaviors. Deep learning techniques are often utilized in different HAR approaches to recover features and classification swiftly because of the introduction and development of vast computing resources. The vast majority of solutions, on the other hand, depend on simplistic feature extraction algorithms incapable of recognizing complicated behaviors. Due to advancements in high computational capabilities, deep learning algorithms are now often utilized in HAR methods to efficiently extract meaningful features which can successfully categorize sensor data. In this chapter, we present a hybrid deep learning-based classification model comprising of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), which is named CNN-LSTM. The proposed hybrid deep learning model has been tested over three benchmark HAR datasets: MHEALTH, OPPORTUNITY, and HARTH. On the aforementioned datasets, the proposed hybrid model obtained 99.07%, 95.2%, and 94.68% classification accuracies, respectively, which is quite impressive. The source code of the proposed work can be accessed by using the following link: https://github.com/DSharma05/Human-Activity-Recognition-using-hybrid-Deep-learning-approach."

                "Understanding howAI and robotics impact theworkplace is fundamental for understanding the broader impact of these technologies on the economy and society. It can also help in developing realistic scenarios about how jobs and skill demand will be redefined in the next decades and how education systems should evolve in response. This chapter provides a literature review of studies that aim at measuring the extent to which AI and robotics can automate work. The chapter presents five assessment approaches: 1) an approach that focuses on occupational tasks and analyzes whether these tasks can be automated; 2) an approach that draws on information from patents to assess <em>computer</em> capabilities; 3) indicators that use AI-related job postings as a proxy for AI deployment in firms; 4) measures relying on benchmarks from <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>; 5) and an approach that compares <em>computer</em> capabilities to human skills using standardized tests developed for humans. The chapter discusses the differences between these measurement approaches and assesses their strengths and weaknesses. It concludes by formulating recommendations for future work."

                "Microfluidic systems mainly evolved from five fields of <em>science</em> and engineering which are electronics, biology, mechanical, chemistry and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. These systems with the combination of <em>science</em> and engineering are mainly utilized in four diagnostic applications which are cell analysis, enzyme analysis, organ-level diagnostics and whole blood analysis with potential markets in hospitals, pathological labs and individual households. Biological cell plays a major role in human health and can provide sufficient information for early-stage healthcare diagnostics for many fatal diseases when cells get damaged. Some diseases are critical that can become incurable over time so detection of such diseases at the cell level is very much desired. Homogenous microparticles such as polystyrene particles are used in the medical field for replicating the behaviour of biological cells for preliminary use. The dielectrophoresis technique works based on dipole movement inside cells and in the fluidic medium while under the influence of a non-uniform electric field."

                "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a comprehensive branch of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> concerned with building smart systems that can leverage <em>computers</em> and machines to mimic the thinking and problem-solving capabilities of the human mind. The development of AI in terms of software and hardware implementations is quite vast. AI has also started progressing extensively in other areas such as healthcare, astronomy, agriculture, the automobile industry, education, finance, and voice recognition. Over the last few decades, AI has shown massive growth in healthcare. The major driving forces are the growing complexity and size of datasets of patients’ health-related information and the increase in demand for personalized medicine. Despite having the potential to positively transform various aspects of healthcare, the development of AI on a large scale in a clinical environment is still challenging and requires the identification of gaps between AI and healthcare. In this chapter, the authors review the up-to-date technological growth of AI in healthcare and try to come up with solutions to the challenges posed by AI in this sector."
