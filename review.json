                "Neuromarketing is an emerging research field that aims to understand consumers’ decision-making processes when choosing which product to buy. This information is highly sought after by businesses looking to improve their marketing strategies by understanding what leaves a positive or negative impression on consumers. It has the potential to revolutionize the marketing industry by enabling companies to offer engaging experiences, create more effective advertisements, avoid the wrong marketing strategies, and ultimately save millions of dollars for businesses. Therefore, good documentation is necessary to capture the current research situation in this vital sector. In this article, we present a systematic review of EEG-based Neuromarketing. We aim to shed light on the research trends, technical scopes, and potential opportunities in this field. We reviewed recent publications from valid databases and divided the popular research topics in Neuromarketing into five clusters to present the current research trend in this field. We also discuss the brain regions that are activated when making purchase decisions and their relevance to Neuromarketing applications. The article provides appropriate illustrations of marketing stimuli that can elicit authentic impressions from consumers' minds, the techniques used to process and analyze recorded brain data, and the current strategies employed to interpret the data. Finally, we offer recommendations to upcoming researchers to help them investigate the possibilities in this area more efficiently in the future."

                "Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) testing is an approach used for verification and validation in the energy sector. However, there is no comprehensive overview of the application, potential, and challenges of SIL within this sector. Therefore, this paper conducts a thorough scoping review of the existing literature within the scope of SIL and related in-the-loop approaches in the energy sector. A total of 88 full-text articles from four significant databases ACM, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of <em>Science</em> are analyzed and categorized to map the purpose, methods, architecture, interoperability and protocols, technologies, challenges, and limitations. The results present a grand perspective of in-the-loop across several domains followed by an analysis of SIL in the energy sector. The application domains carry characteristics from complex systems, systems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems, critical systems, real-time systems, and sociotechnical systems. The energy sector and the automotive industry are amongst the most applied domains. Within energy- and electricity systems, hardware-based in-the-loop paradigms are mostly applied for testing low-level signaling, and SIL is used for control strategy testing, optimization, dispatching, and experimentation. The examined SIL architectures have distributed-, real-time, and closed-loop properties, and are constrained by specialized simulation power hardware. Future research should address how to systematically develop SIL testing environments with guiding principles to support application development for the future digitalized energy system."

                "Computational Pathology (CPath) is an interdisciplinary <em>science</em> that augments developments of computational approaches to analyze and model medical histopathology images. The main objective for CPath is to develop infrastructure and workflows of digital diagnostics as an assistive CAD system for clinical pathology, facilitating transformational changes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer that are mainly address by CPath tools. With evergrowing developments in deep learning and <em>computer</em> vision algorithms, and the ease of the data flow from digital pathology, currently CPath is witnessing a paradigm shift. Despite the sheer volume of engineering and scientific works being introduced for cancer image analysis, there is still a considerable gap of adopting and integrating these algorithms in clinical practice. This raises a significant question regarding the direction and trends that are undertaken in CPath. In this article we provide a comprehensive review of more than 800 papers to address the challenges faced in problem design all-the-way to the application and implementation viewpoints. We have catalogued each paper into a model-card by examining the key works and challenges faced to layout the current landscape in CPath. We hope this helps the community to locate relevant works and facilitate understanding of the field's future directions. In a nutshell, we oversee the CPath developments in cycle of stages which are required to be cohesively linked together to address the challenges associated with such multidisciplinary <em>science</em>. We overview this cycle from different perspectives of data-centric, model-centric, and application-centric problems. We finally sketch remaining challenges and provide directions for future technical developments and clinical integration of CPath. For updated information on this survey review paper and accessing to the original model cards repository, please refer to GitHub. Updated version of this draft can also be found from arXiv."

                "Implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) is a complex and challenging task. <em>Computer</em> technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), has been explored to promote the CPG implementation. This study has reviewed the main domains where <em>computer</em> technology and AI has been applied to CPG implementation. PubMed, Embase, Web of <em>science</em>, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, WanFang DATA, VIP database, and China Biology Medicine disc database were searched from inception to December 2021. Studies involving the utilization of <em>computer</em> technology and AI to promote the implementation of CPGs were eligible for review. A total of 10429 published articles were identified, 117 met the inclusion criteria. 21 (17.9%) focused on the utilization of AI techniques to classify or extract the relative content of CPGs, such as recommendation sentence, condition-action sentences. 47 (40.2%) focused on the utilization of <em>computer</em> technology to represent guideline knowledge to make it understandable by <em>computer</em>. 15 (12.8%) focused on the utilization of AI techniques to verify the relative content of CPGs, such as conciliation of multiple single-disease guidelines for comorbid patients. 34 (29.1%) focused on the utilization of AI techniques to integrate guideline knowledge into different resources, such as clinical decision support systems. We conclude that the application of <em>computer</em> technology and AI to CPG implementation mainly concentrated on the guideline content classification and extraction, guideline knowledge representation, guideline knowledge verification, and guideline knowledge integration. The AI methods used for guideline content classification and extraction were pattern-based algorithm and machine learning. In guideline knowledge representation, guideline knowledge verification, and guideline knowledge integration, <em>computer</em> techniques of knowledge representation were the most used."

                "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> that involves acquiring information, developing rule bases, and mimicking human behaviour. The fundamental concept behind AI is to create intelligent <em>computer</em> systems that can operate with minimal human intervention or without any intervention at all. These rule-based systems are developed using various machine learning and deep learning models, enabling them to solve complex problems. AI is integrated with these models to learn, understand, and analyse provided data. The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping numerous industries, with the pharmaceutical sector experiencing a notable transformation. AI is increasingly being employed to automate, optimize, and personalize various facets of the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in pharmacological research. Traditional drug development methods areknown for being time-consuming, expensive, and less efficient, often taking around a decade and costing billions of dollars. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques addresses these challenges by enabling the examination of compounds with desired properties from a vast pool of input drugs. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in drug screening by predicting toxicity, bioactivity, ADME properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion), physicochemical properties, and more. AI enhances the drug design process by improving the efficiency and accuracy of predicting drug behaviour, interactions, and properties. These approaches further significantly improve the precision of drug discovery processes and decrease clinical trial costs leading to the development of more effective drugs."

                "Recently significant effort has been invested in studying commonalities of human brain operation and advanced algorithms for machine learning to answer the question: Can the learning mechanisms, identified in the operation of the brain, be mimicked in artificial neural networks to enhance the learning efficiency with simultaneous reduction in complexity and power consumption. At the same time, machine learning algorithms, on their own, become increasingly complex, resulting in complex neural networks. To speed up the machine learning algorithms, research on 7G networks will be looking for new computing technologies, like quantum (q-) computing (QC), and new models for complex networks that will enable us to efficiently control/optimize the processes run on them. In this paper, under the umbrella of well-established complex networks theory, we provide a unified presentation of how quantum computing, implemented on near-future <em>computers</em>, can enable solving various problems in the above disciplines, otherwise difficult to solve by using classical (c-) approaches. The emphasis is on the commonalities in QC applications and modeling for the different systems listed above. For 7G network designers, the survey is expected to provide an insight into how much the research results in natural, QC based <em>sciences</em> can be integrated into new network paradigms to support above initiatives."

                "In recent years, smart agriculture has gained strength due to the application of industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture. As a result, efforts are increasing in proposing artificial vision applications to solve many problems. However, many of these applications are developed separately. Many academic works have proposed solutions integrating image classification techniques through IoT platforms. For this reason, this paper aims to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the main problems to be solved with smart farming IoT platforms that incorporate images? (2) What are the main strategies for incorporating image classification methods in smart agriculture IoT platforms? and (3) What are the main image acquisition, preprocessing, transmission, and classification technologies used in smart agriculture IoT platforms? This study adopts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach. We searched Scopus, Web of <em>Science</em>, IEEE Xplore, and Springer Link databases from January 2018 to July 2022. From which we could identify five domains corresponding to (1) disease and pest detection, (2) crop growth and health monitoring, (3) irrigation and crop protection management, (4) intrusion detection, and (5) fruits and plant counting. There are three types of strategies to integrate image data into smart agriculture IoT platforms: (1) classification process in the edge, (2) classification process in the cloud, and (3) classification process combined. The main advantage of the first is obtaining data in real-time, and its main disadvantage is the cost of implementation. On the other hand, the main advantage of the second is the ability to process high-resolution images, and its main disadvantage is the need for high-bandwidth connectivity. Finally, the mixed strategy can significantly benefit infrastructure investment, but most works are experimental."

                "Influence maximization is an important research area in social network analysis where researchers are concerned with detecting influential nodes. The detection of influential nodes is of great interest in several disciplines including <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, opinion propagation, political movements, or economics, where systems are often modeled as graphs. The Influence Maximization problem is proved NP-hard. This computational complexity is justified by two main factors. The first factor is about the important size of social networks. Modern social networks like TikTok and Facebook have reached an unprecedented number of users. Dynamic social networks, whose topology or/and informational content is able to evolve, represent the second factor. Maximizing influence in such networks remains a significant task. In this light, several methods have been proposed. Being motivated by this fact, we provide in this paper a detailed survey of influence maximization approaches. Our main concern is to provide a taxonomy of existing models in both static and dynamic networks. In addition, we provide a comparison of the state-of-the-art approaches according to a clear categorization. New trends for detecting influential nodes are also discussed. We provide then some challenges as well as future directions."

                "Background: Parkinson's Disease (PD) demands early diagnosis and frequent assessment of symptoms. In particular, analysing hand movements is pivotal to understand disease progression. Advancements in hand tracking using Deep Learning (DL) allow for the automatic and objective disease evaluation from video recordings of standardised motor tasks, which are the foundation of neurological examinations. In view of this scenario, this narrative review aims to describe the state of the art and the future perspective of DL frameworks for hand tracking in video-based PD assessment. Methods: A rigorous search of PubMed, Web of <em>Science</em>, IEEE Explorer, and Scopus until October 2023 using primary keywords such as parkinson, hand tracking, and deep learning was performed to select eligible by focusing on video-based PD assessment through DL-driven hand tracking frameworks Results: After accurate screening, 23 publications met the selection criteria. These studies used various solutions, from well-established pose estimation frameworks, like OpenPose and MediaPipe, to custom deep architectures designed to accurately track hand and finger movements and extract relevant disease features. Estimated hand tracking data were then used to differentiate PD patients from healthy individuals, characterise symptoms such as tremors and bradykinesia, or regress the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) by automatically assessing clinical tasks such as finger tapping, hand movements, and pronation-supination. Conclusions: DL-driven hand tracking holds promise for PD assessment, offering precise, objective measurements for early diagnosis and monitoring, especially in a telemedicine scenario. However, to ensure clinical acceptance, standardisation and validation are crucial. Future research should prioritise large open datasets, rigorous validation on patients, and the investigation of new frontiers such as tracking hand-hand and hand-object interactions for daily-life tasks assessment."

                "Reinforcement learning (RL) is one important branch of artificial intelligence (AI), which intuitively imitates the learning style of human beings. It is commonly derived from solving game playing problems and is extensively used for decision-making, control and optimization problems. It has been extensively applied for solving complicated problems with the property of Markov decision-making processes. With data accumulation and comprehensive analysis, researchers are not only satisfied with predicting the results for experimental systems but also hope to design or control them for the sake of obtaining the desired properties or functions. RL is potentially facilitated to solve a large number of complicated biological and chemical problems, because they could be decomposed into multi-step decision-making process. In practice, substantial progress has been made in the application of RL to the field of biomedicine. In this paper, we will first give a brief description about RL, including its definition, basic theory and different type of methods. Then we will review some detailed applications in various domains, for example, molecular design, reaction planning, molecular simulation and etc. In the end, we will summarize the essentialities of RL approaches to solve more diverse problems compared with other machine learning methods and also outlook the possible trends to overcome their limitations in the future.

                "The digital technologies employed in archaeology since the 1990s have progressively and experimentally been utilized over the last two decades to document and re-present the ancient polychromy of Greek and Roman marble artworks. Given that this remains a developing field of investigation and application, this study offers, for the first time, a systematic review of the endeavours undertaken thus far in implementing information technology for the documentation, analysis, reconstruction, visualization, and presentation of ancient polychromy. This overview is supported by a literature review and existing implementations, organized into methods and techniques employed for 3D colour preservation, analysis, and reconstruction, as well as those used for the visualization and dissemination of findings. The goal is to identify gaps and provide intriguing insights for future research concerning the use of digital technologies as an essential tool in the stages of documenting and disseminating ancient polychromy in architecture and archaeological artefacts. This, in turn, aims to encourage data sharing, contribute to the dissemination of <em>science</em>-based knowledge and resolve substantial barriers associated with the long-term retention of digital data."

                "The past decade has witnessed the rapid development and adoption of machine and deep learning (ML & DL) methodologies in agricultural systems, showcased by great successes in applications such as smart crop management, smart plant breeding, smart livestock farming, precision aquaculture farming, and agricultural robotics. However, these conventional ML/DL models have certain limitations: they heavily rely on large, costly-to-acquire labeled datasets for training, require specialized expertise for development and maintenance, and are mostly tailored for specific tasks, thus lacking generalizability. Recently, large pre-trained models, also known as foundation models (FMs), have demonstrated remarkable successes in language, vision, and decision-making tasks across various domains. These models are trained on a vast amount of data from multiple domains and modalities. Once trained, they can accomplish versatile tasks with just minor fine-tuning and minimal task-specific labeled data. Despite their proven effectiveness and huge potential, there has been little exploration of applying FMs to agriculture artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential of FMs in the field of smart agriculture. In particular, conceptual tools and technical background are presented to facilitate the understanding of the problem space and uncover new research directions in this field. To this end, recent FMs in the general <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> (CS) domain are reviewed, and the models are categorized into four categories: language FMs, vision FMs, multimodal FMs, and reinforcement learning FMs. Subsequently, the process of developing agriculture FMs (AFMs) is outlined and their potential applications in smart agriculture are discussed. In addition, the unique challenges and risks associated with developing AFMs are discussed, including model training, validation, and deployment. Through this study, the advancement of AI in agriculture is explored by introducing AFMs as a promising paradigm that can significantly mitigate the reliance on extensive labeled datasets and enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization of agricultural AI systems. To facilitate further research, a well-classified and actively updated list of papers on AFMs is organized and accessible at https://github.com/JiajiaLi04/Agriculture-Foundation-Models."

                "Affective computing, a field at the intersection of cognitive <em>science</em>, linguistics, and AI, seeks to enhance human–<em>computer</em> interactions. Recognizing the complexity of human emotions, which manifest across various channels, this paper advocates for a multi-modal approach to accurately recognize emotions. Such an approach enables the discernment of subtle emotional cues in multiple modalities, thus advancing the field of multi-modal affective computing. Focusing on a trimodal framework, this paper examines emotion recognition and sentiment analysis through text, voice, and visual data. It outlines key developments, current trends, and prominent datasets in trimodal emotional analysis. It also explores data fusion strategies across modalities and assesses various fusion techniques’ effectiveness. The paper presents detailed emotion models, recent advancements, and key trimodal databases, while thoroughly addressing challenges like data processing and the complexities of TAC. Finally, it highlights potential future directions, underscoring the importance of benchmark databases and practical applications to deepen our understanding of the nuanced spectrum of human emotions."

                "Although nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used, some matrix factorization methods result in misleading results and waste of computing resources due to lack of timely optimization and case-by-case consideration. Therefore, an up-to-date and comprehensive review on its algorithms and applications is needed to promote improvement and applications for NMF. Here, we start with introducing background and gathering the principles and formulae of NMF algorithms. There have been dozens of new algorithms since its birth in the 1990s. Generally, several or even more algorithms are adopted in a single software package written in R, Python, C/C++, etc. Besides, the applications of NMF are analyzed. NMF is not only most widely used in modern subjects or techniques such as <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, telecommunications, imaging <em>science</em>, and remote sensing but also increasingly used in traditional subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, and psychology, being accepted by around 130 fields (disciplines) in about 20 years. Finally, the features and performance of different categories of NMF are summarized and evaluated. The summarized advantages and disadvantages and proposed suggestions for improvements are expected to enlighten the future efforts to polish the mathematical principles and procedures of NMF to realize higher accuracy and productivity in practical use."

                "Images and other types of unstructural data in the medical domain are rapidly becoming data-intensive. Actionable insights from these complex data present new opportunities but also pose new challenges for classification or segmentation of unstructural data sources. Over the years, medical problems have been solved by combining traditional statistical methods with image processing methods. Both the increase in the size of the data and the increase in the resolution are among the factors that shape the ongoing improvements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly concerning deep learning (DL) techniques for evaluation of these medical data to identify, classify, and quantify patterns for clinical needs. At this point, it is important to understand how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which are an important milestone in interpreting big data, transform into Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and to predict where the change will go. We aimed to explain the needs of these stages in medical image processing through the studies in the literature. At the same time, information is provided about the studies that lead to paradigm shift and try to solve the image related medical problems by using DCNNs. With the increase in the knowledge of medical doctors on this subject, it will be possible to look at the solution of new problems in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> from different perspectives."

                "Background: Plant diseases affect agricultural output, quality and profitability, making them serious obstacles for agriculture. It is essential to detect diseases early in order to reduce losses while retaining sustainable practices. Plant disease detection has benefited greatly from the use of <em>computer</em> vision and deep learning in recent years because of their outstanding precision and computing capability. Objective: In this paper, we intend to investigate the role of deep learning in <em>computer</em> vision for plant disease detection while looking into how these techniques address complex disease identification problems. A variety of deep learning architectures were reviewed, and the contribution of frameworks such as Tensorflow, Keras, Caffe and PyTorch to the researchers’ model construction was studied as well. Additionally, the usage of open repositories such as PlantVillage and Kaggle along with the customized datasets were discussed. Methods: We gathered the most recent developments in deep learning techniques for leaf disease detection through a systematic literature review of research papers published over the past decade, using reputable academic databases like Scopus and Web of <em>Science</em>, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method for guidance. Results: This study finds that researchers consistently enhance existing deep learning architectures to improve prediction accuracy in plant disease detection, often by introducing novel architectures and employing transfer learning methods. Frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, Caffe, and PyTorch are widely favored for their efficiency in development. Additionally, most studies opt for public datasets such as PlantVillage, Kaggle, and ImageNet, which offer an abundance of labelled data for training and testing deep learning models. Conclusion: While no singular ‘best’ model emerges, the adaptability of deep learning and <em>computer</em> vision demonstrates the dynamic nature of plant disease recognition area, and this paper provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning's transformative impact on plant disease recognition by bringing together information from different studies."

                "Researchers have proposed different obfuscation transformations supported by numerous smartphone protection tools (obfuscators and deobfuscators). However, there is a need for a comprehensive study to empirically characterize these tools that belong to different categories of transformations. We propose a property-based framework to systematically classify twenty cutting-edge tools according to their features, analysis type, programming language support, licensing, applied obfuscation transformations, and general technical drawbacks. Our analysis predominantly reveals that very few tools work at the dynamic level, and most tools (which are static-based) work for Java or Java-based ecosystems (e.g., Android). The findings also show that the widespread adoption of renaming transformations is followed by formatting and code injection. In addition, this paper pinpoints the technical shortcomings of each tool; some of these drawbacks are common in static-based analyzers (e.g., resource consumption), and other drawbacks have negative effects on the experiment conducted by students (e.g., a third-party library involved). According to these critical limitations, we provide some timely recommendations for further research. This study can assist not only Android developers and researchers to improve the overall health of their apps but also the managers of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and cybersecurity academic programs to embed suitable obfuscation tools in their curricula."

                "Cephalometry is a crucial examination in orthodontic diagnostics and during the planning of orthognathic surgical procedures. The objective of this article was to compare cephalometric measurements conducted by different specialists and systems tailored for such measurements, as well as to evaluate the capabilities of artificial intelligence in this field. In January 2024, we conducted electronic searches in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of <em>Science</em> (WoS) databases. In the Scopus database, the results were refined to titles, abstracts, and keywords, while in PubMed, they were narrowed down to titles and abstracts. In WoS, the results were refined only to abstracts. The search criteria were based on the following terms: (cephalometric) AND (analysis) AND (discrepancy) AND ((orthodontic) OR (radiologist)). A total of 263 articles were identified, of which 17 met the criteria and were incorporated into the review. The review allowed us to conclude that the accuracy of cephalometric measurements relied on the expertise of the operator—specialists with more experience exhibited greater precision compared to novices or individuals not specialized in orthodontics. Cephalometric measurement <em>computer</em> programs yielded outcomes that streamlined work processes, minimized human errors, and enhanced precision. A novel aspect involved the application of artificial intelligence, which also demonstrated high precision and a substantial reduction in working time, although its utilization still necessitates further enhancements. Further research was required to address these limitations and to optimize the incorporation of technology in orthodontic and orthognathic surgery practices."

                "The main purpose of anti-forensic <em>computer</em> techniques, in the broadest sense, is to hinder the investigation of a <em>computer</em> attack by eliminating traces and preventing the collection of data contained in a <em>computer</em> system. Nowadays, cyber-attacks are becoming more and more frequent and sophisticated, so it is necessary to understand the techniques used by hackers to be able to carry out a correct forensic analysis leading to the identification of the perpetrators. Despite its importance, this is a poorly represented area in the scientific literature. The disparity of the existing works, together with the small number of articles, makes it challenging to find one’s way around the vast world of <em>computer</em> forensics. This article presents a comprehensive review of the existing scientific literature on anti-forensic techniques, mainly DFIR (digital forensics incident response), organizing the studies according to their subject matter and orientation. It also presents key ideas that contribute to the understanding of this field of forensic <em>science</em> and details the shortcomings identified after reviewing the state of the art."

                "Cyber–physical systems (CPSs), which combine <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, control systems, and physical elements, have become essential in modern industrial and societal contexts. However, their extensive integration presents increasing security challenges, particularly due to recurring cyber attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to explore CPS security control. In this review, we systematically examine the prevalent cyber attacks affecting CPSs, such as denial of service, false data injection, and replay attacks, explaining their impacts on CPSs’ operation and integrity, as well as summarizing classic attack detection methods. Regarding CPSs’ security control approaches, we comprehensively outline protective strategies and technologies, including event-triggered control, switching control, predictive control, and optimal control. These approaches aim to effectively counter various cyber threats and strengthen CPSs’ security and resilience. Lastly, we anticipate future advancements in CPS security control, envisioning strategies to address emerging cyber risks and innovations in intelligent security control techniques."

                "The main purpose of this study is to examine the implementation of active methodologies in the teaching–learning process in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. To achieve this objective, a systematic review using the PRISMA method was performed; the search for articles was conducted through the Scopus and Web of <em>Science</em> databases and the scientific search engine Google Scholar. By establishing inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 research papers were selected addressing the use of various active methodologies which have had a positive impact on students’ learning processes. Among the principal active methodologies highlighted are problem-based learning, flipped classrooms, and gamification. The results of the review show how active methodologies promote significant learning, in addition to fostering more outstanding commitment, participation, and motivation on the students’ part. It was observed that active methodologies contribute to the development of fundamental cognitive and socio-emotional skills for their professional growth."

                "Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized robotics by enhancing perception, adaptability, decision-making and more, enabling robots to work in complex scenarios beyond the capabilities of traditional approaches. However, the downsizing of robots to micro- and nanoscales introduces new challenges. For example, complexities in the actuation and locomotion of micro- and nanorobots defy traditional modelling methods, while control and navigation are complicated by strong environmental disruptions, and tracking in vivo encounters substantial noise interference. Recently, ML has also been shown to offer a promising avenue to tackle these complexities. Here we discuss how ML advances many crucial aspects of micro- and nanorobots, that is, in their design, actuation, locomotion, planning, tracking and navigation. Any application that can benefit from these fundamental advancements will be a potential beneficiary of this field, including micromanipulation, targeted delivery and therapy, bio-sensing, diagnosis and so on. This Review aims to provide an accessible and comprehensive survey for readers to quickly appreciate recent exciting accomplishments in ML for micro- and nanorobots. We also discuss potential issues and prospects of this burgeoning research direction. We hope this Review can foster interdisciplinary collaborations across robotics, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, material <em>science</em> and allied disciplines, to develop ML techniques that surmount fundamental challenges and further expand the application horizons of micro- and nanorobotics in biomedicine."

                "The introduction of machine learning in digital pathology has deeply impacted the field, especially with the advent of whole slide image (WSI) analysis. In this review, we tried to elucidate the role of machine learning algorithms in diagnostic precision, efficiency, and the reproducibility of the results. First, we discuss some of the most used tools, including QuPath, HistoQC, and HistomicsTK, and provide an updated overview of machine learning approaches and their application in pathology. Later, we report how these tools may simplify the automation of WSI analyses, also reducing manual workload and inter-observer variability. A novel aspect of this review is its focus on open-source tools, presented in a way that may help the adoption process for pathologists. Furthermore, we highlight the major benefits of these technologies, with the aim of making this review a practical guide for clinicians seeking to implement machine learning-based solutions in their specific workflows. Moreover, this review also emphasizes some crucial limitations related to data quality and the interpretability of the models, giving insight into future directions for research. Overall, this work tries to bridge the gap between the more recent technological progress in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and traditional clinical practice, supporting a broader, yet smooth, adoption of machine learning approaches in digital pathology."

                "Queer individuals face significant obstacles in the fields of <em>science</em>, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), and computing, including high levels of harassment and professional limitations [1], but only some of these STEM fields have been recently promoting the integration and welcoming of people with queer identities to increase representation and inclusion. (Queer is used here as an umbrella term for those who do not identify as heterosexual or cisgender, often labeled the LGBTQIA+ community.) This situation drove the creation of organizations like Queer in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Queer in Human-<em>Computer</em> Interaction (HCI) that study and monitor the inclusion of queer people and provide safe and welcoming spaces within their respective scientific communities. Initial studies performed by these organizations found areas for their fields to improve. Queer in HCI studies indicated that queer people face significant pressures and barriers not experienced by all HCI researchers [2]. Queer in AI demographic surveys showed that 67% of the group's members faced at least one safety incident in 2021, 79.9% of its members reported mental health issues that impaired their ability to conduct research, and 77.4% of its members struggled with a lack of community that they could rely on [3]. Other challenges include inaccessibility to conferences, due to local discrimination toward queer people; lack of tailored academic support; inflexible name change policies; and lack of representation [4]. Both Queer in AI and Queer in HCI have shed light on these issues while increasing the level of involvement and feeling of belonging of the queer communities in their respective research fields, benefits that we would like to see extended to the robotics community."

                "The rapid evolution of modern technology has made artificial intelligence (AI) an important emerging tool in healthcare. AI, which is a broad field of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, can be used to develop systems or machines equipped with the ability to tackle tasks that traditionally necessitate human intelligence. AI can be used to perform multifaceted tasks that involve the synthesis of large amounts of data with the generation of solutions, algorithms, and decision support tools. Various AI approaches, including machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), are increasingly being used to analyze vast healthcare datasets. In addition, visual AI has the potential to revolutionize surgery and the intraoperative experience for surgeons through augmented reality enhancing surgical navigation in real-time. Specific applications of AI in hepatobiliary tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary tract cancer can improve patient diagnosis, prognostic risk stratification, as well as treatment allocation based on ML-based models. The integration of radiomics data and AI models can also improve clinical decision making. We herein review how AI may be of particular interest in the care of patients with complex cancers, such as hepatobiliary tumors, as these patients often require a multimodal treatment approach."

                "Background: Heart failure (HF), a global health challenge, requires innovative diagnostic and management approaches. The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) in healthcare necessitates a comprehensive review to evaluate these developments and their potential to enhance HF evaluation, aligning clinical practices with technological advancements. Objective: This review aims to systematically explore the contributions of DL technologies in the assessment of HF, focusing on their potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, personalize treatment strategies, and address the impact of comorbidities. Methods: A thorough literature search was conducted across four major electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of <em>Science</em> and IEEE Xplore, yielding 137 articles that were subsequently categorized into five primary application areas: cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification, HF detection, image analysis, risk assessment, and other clinical analyses. The selection criteria focused on studies utilizing DL algorithms for HF assessment, not limited to HF detection but extending to any attempt in analyzing and interpreting HF-related data. Results: The analysis revealed a notable emphasis on CVD classification and HF detection, with DL algorithms showing significant promise in distinguishing between affected individuals and healthy subjects. Furthermore, the review highlights DL's capacity to identify underlying cardiomyopathies and other comorbidities, underscoring its utility in refining diagnostic processes and tailoring treatment plans to individual patient needs. Conclusions: This review establishes DL as a key innovation in HF management, highlighting its role in advancing diagnostic accuracy and personalized care. The insights provided advocate for the integration of DL in clinical settings and suggest directions for future research to enhance patient outcomes in HF care."

                "Context: Computational modeling involves the use of <em>computer</em> simulations and models to study and understand real-world phenomena. Its application is particularly relevant in the study of potential interactions between biological elements. It is a promising approach to understand complex biological processes and predict their behavior under various conditions. Methodology: This paper is a review of the recent literature on computational modeling of biological systems. Our study focuses on the field of oncology and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and, in particular, agent-based modeling (ABM), between 2010 and May 2023. Results: Most of the articles studied focus on improving the diagnosis and understanding the behaviors of biological entities, with metaheuristic algorithms being the models most used. Several challenges are highlighted regarding increasing and structuring knowledge about biological systems, developing holistic models that capture multiple scales and levels of organization, reproducing emergent behaviors of biological systems, validating models with experimental data, improving computational performance of models and algorithms, and ensuring privacy and personal data protection are discussed."

                "Hematology is the study of diagnosis and treatment options for blood diseases, including cancer. Cancer is considered one of the deadliest diseases across all age categories. Diagnosing such a deadly disease at the initial stage is essential to cure the disease. Hematologists and pathologists rely on microscopic evaluation of blood or bone marrow smear images to diagnose blood-related ailments. The abundance of overlapping cells, cells of varying densities among platelets, non-illumination levels, and the amount of red and white blood cells make it more difficult to diagnose illness using blood cell images. Pathologists are required to put more effort into the traditional, time-consuming system. Nowadays, it becomes possible with machine learning and deep learning techniques, to automate the diagnostic processes, categorize microscopic blood cells, and improve the accuracy of the procedure and its speed as the models developed using these methods may guide an assisting tool. In this article, we have acquired, analyzed, scrutinized, and finally selected around 57 research papers from various machine learning and deep learning methodologies that have been employed in the diagnosis of leukemia and its classification over the past 20 years, which have been published between the years 2003 and 2023 by PubMed, IEEE, <em>Science</em> Direct, Google Scholar and other pertinent sources. Our primary emphasis is on evaluating the advantages and limitations of analogous research endeavors to provide a concise and valuable research directive that can be of significant utility to fellow researchers in the field."

                "Modern lithography, which enables the fabrication of complex structures in biomedical devices with exceptional precision, is a potentially transformative force in the neural <em>sciences</em>. Techniques such as photolithography, electron beam lithography, and soft lithography have been utilized to produce devices that guide neuronal growth and differentiation and measure electrophysiological signals at the single-cell level. In the clinical sphere, lithography plays a role in the manufacturing of devices for deep brain stimulation, brain-<em>computer</em> interface, and neuroprosthetics. Here, we briefly review the applications of lithography in basic and translational neuroscience and clinical neurology, with an eye toward future advancement."

                "Emotion is an interdisciplinary research field investigated by many research areas such as psychology, philosophy, computing, and others. Emotions influence how we make decisions, plan, reason, and deal with various aspects. Automated human emotion recognition (AHER) is a critical research topic in <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>. It can be applied in many applications such as marketing, human–robot interaction, electronic games, E-learning, and many more. It is essential for any application requiring to know the emotional state of the person and act accordingly. The automated methods for recognizing emotions use many modalities such as facial expressions, written text, speech, and various biosignals such as the electroencephalograph, blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, and others to recognize emotions. The signals can be used individually(uni-modal) or as a combination of more than one modality (multi-modal). Most of the work presented is in laboratory experiments and personalized models. Recent research is concerned about in the wild experiments and creating generic models. This study presents a comprehensive review and an evaluation of the state-of-the-art methods for AHER employing machine learning from a <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> perspective and directions for future research work."

                "Background: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increased in all education sectors including K-12 settings where students can learn about AI and have an augmented learning experience using AI. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review is to provide a more complete and nuanced understanding of the role and impact of AI in K-12 education by synthesizing publication trends, AI research themes, AI methods and technology applications, and AI use by students and teachers in K-12 educational settings. Methods: The systematic review searched Web of <em>Science</em> and six databases indexed in EBSCO host. A PRISMA flow chart was applied to search and screen for studies. Articles were screened at the title, abstract and full-text level and coded and analyzed. Results: Themes in 66 AI studies include AI as a predictor and indicator of academic behavior or performance, AI curriculum design, integrating AI in various subjects, evaluation of AI in education, AI to enhance learning environments and school operations, AI ethics, and the equity and safety of AI. AI methods were grouped into Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning. AI technology applications were Machine Learning (ML) model building tools, intelligent tutors, chat bot, educational games, AI robots and virtual reality devices. AI applications were mostly used by teachers for ML model demonstration, academic performance prediction and behavior prediction. AI was used by students for scientific discovery learning, improving learning experience and data driven decisions. Conclusion: This review has implications for K-12 school personnel and researchers. Practitioners can use the findings to implement AI in K-12 education. Researchers can benefit from the findings of the review but also build on the gap in research on AI K-12 education."

                "The rise of modern <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> enabled physical chemistry to make enormous progresses in understanding and harnessing natural and artificial phenomena. Nevertheless, despite the advances achieved over past decades, computational resources are still insufficient to thoroughly simulate extended systems from first principles. Indeed, countless biological, catalytic and photophysical processes require ab initio treatments to be properly described, but the breadth of length and time scales involved makes it practically unfeasible. A way to address these issues is to couple theories and algorithms working at different scales by dividing the system into domains treated at different levels of approximation, ranging from quantum mechanics to classical molecular dynamics, even including continuum electrodynamics. This approach is known as multiscale modeling and its use over the past 60 years has led to remarkable results. Considering the rapid advances in theory, algorithm design, and computing power, we believe multiscale modeling will massively grow into a dominant research methodology in the forthcoming years. Hereby we describe the main approaches developed within its realm, highlighting their achievements and current drawbacks, eventually proposing a plausible direction for future developments considering also the emergence of new computational techniques such as machine learning and quantum computing. We then discuss how advanced multiscale modeling methods could be exploited to address critical scientific challenges, focusing on the simulation of complex light-harvesting processes, such as natural photosynthesis. While doing so, we suggest a cutting-edge computational paradigm consisting in performing simultaneous multiscale calculations on a system allowing the various domains, treated with appropriate accuracy, to move and extend while they properly interact with each other. Although this vision is very ambitious, we believe the quick development of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> will lead to both massive improvements and widespread use of these techniques, resulting in enormous progresses in physical chemistry and, eventually, in our society."

                "Physics is living an era of unprecedented cross-fertilization among the different areas of <em>science</em>. In this perspective review, we discuss the manifold impact that state-of-the-art cold and ultracold-atomic platforms can have in fundamental and applied <em>science</em> through the development of platforms for quantum simulation, computation, metrology and sensing. We illustrate how the engineering of table-top experiments with atom technologies is engendering applications to understand problems in condensed matter and fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics, unveil foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, and advance quantum chemistry and the emerging field of quantum biology. In this journey, we take the perspective of two main approaches, i.e., creating quantum analogues and building quantum simulators, highlighting that independently of the ultimate goal of a universal quantum <em>computer</em> to be met, the remarkable transformative effects of these achievements remain unchanged. We wish to convey three main messages. First, this atom-based quantum technology enterprise is signing a new era in the way quantum technologies are used for fundamental <em>science</em>, even beyond the advancement of knowledge, which is characterised by truly cross-disciplinary research, extended interplay between theoretical and experimental thinking, and intersectoral approach. Second, quantum many-body physics is unavoidably taking center stage in frontier’s <em>science</em>. Third, quantum <em>science</em> and technology progress will have capillary impact on society, meaning this effect is not confined to isolated or highly specialized areas of knowledge, but is expected to reach and have a pervasive influence on a broad range of society aspects: while this happens, the adoption of a responsible research and innovation approach to quantum technologies is mandatory, to accompany citizens in building awareness and future scaffolding. Following on all the above reflections, this perspective review is thus aimed at scientists active or interested in interdisciplinary research, providing the reader with an overview of the current status of these wide fields of research where cold and ultracold-atomic platforms play a vital role in their description and simulation."

                "This paper presents a narrative review of the current practices in assessing learners’ cognitive abilities and the limitations of traditional intelligence tests in capturing a comprehensive understanding of a child’s learning potential. Referencing prior research, it explores the concept of dynamic assessment (DA) as a promising yet underutilised alternative that focuses on a child’s responsiveness to learning opportunities. The paper highlights the potential of novel technologies, in particular tangible user interfaces (TUIs), in integrating computational <em>science</em> with DA to improve the access and accuracy of assessment results, especially for children with communication support needs (CSN), as a catalyst for abetting critical communicative competencies. However, existing research in this area has mainly focused on the automated mediation of DA, neglecting the human element that is crucial for effective solutions in special education. A framework is proposed to address these issues, combining pedagogical and sociocultural elements alongside adaptive information technology solutions in an assessment system informed by user-centred design principles to fully support teachers/facilitators and learners with CSN within the special education ecosystem."

                "Three-dimensional soft tissue simulation has become a popular tool in the process of virtual orthognathic surgery planning and patient–surgeon communication. To apply 3D soft tissue simulation software in routine clinical practice, both qualitative and quantitative validation of its accuracy are required. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on the accuracy of 3D soft tissue simulation in orthognathic surgery. The Web of <em>Science</em>, PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were consulted for the literature search. The systematic review (SR) was conducted according to the PRISMA statement, and 40 articles fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Quadas-2 tool was used for the risk of bias assessment for selected studies. A mean error varying from 0.27 mm to 2.9 mm for 3D soft tissue simulations for the whole face was reported. In the studies evaluating 3D soft tissue simulation accuracy after a Le Fort I osteotomy only, the upper lip and paranasal regions were reported to have the largest error, while after an isolated bilateral sagittal split osteotomy, the largest error was reported for the lower lip and chin regions. In the studies evaluating simulation after bimaxillary osteotomy with or without genioplasty, the highest inaccuracy was reported at the level of the lips, predominantly the lower lip, chin, and, sometimes, the paranasal regions. Due to the variability in the study designs and analysis methods, a direct comparison was not possible. Therefore, based on the results of this SR, guidelines to systematize the workflow for evaluating the accuracy of 3D soft tissue simulations in orthognathic surgery in future studies are proposed."

                "Gait and balance have emerged as a critical area of research in health technology. Gait and balance studies have been affected by the researchers’ slow follow-up of research advances due to the absence of visual inspection of the study literature across decades. This study uses advanced search methods to analyse the literature on gait and balance in older adults from 1993 to 2022 in the Web of <em>Science</em> (WoS) database to gain a better understanding of the current status and trends in the field for the first time. The study analysed 4484 academic publications including journal articles and conference proceedings on gait and balance in older adults. Bibliometric analysis methods were applied to examine the publication year, number of publications, discipline distribution, journal distribution, research institutions, application fields, test methods, analysis theories, and influencing factors in the field of gait and balance. The results indicate that the publication of relevant research documents has been steadily increasing from 1993 to 2022. The United States (US) exhibits the highest number of publications with 1742 articles. The keyword “elderly person” exhibits a strong citation burst strength of 18.04, indicating a significant focus on research related to the health of older adults. With a burst factor of 20.46, Harvard University has made impressive strides in the subject. The University of Pittsburgh displayed high research skills in the area of gait and balance with a burst factor of 7.7 and a publication count of 103. The research on gait and balance mainly focuses on physical performance evaluation approaches, and the primary study methods include experimental investigations, computational modelling, and observational studies. The field of gait and balance research is increasingly intertwined with <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and artificial intelligence (AI), paving the way for intelligent monitoring of gait and balance in the elderly. Moving forward, the future of gait and balance research is anticipated to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, intelligence-driven approaches, and advanced visualization techniques."

                "Regular railway inspections are crucial for maintaining their safety and efficiency. However, traditional inspection methods are complex and expensive. Consequently, there has been a significant shift toward combining remote sensing (RS) and machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of railway defect monitoring while reducing costs. The advantages of RS-ML techniques include their ability to automate and refine inspection processes and address challenges such as image quality and methodological limitations. However, the integration of RS and ML in railway monitoring is an emerging field, with diverse methodologies and outcomes that the research has not yet synthesized. To fill this gap, this study conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to consolidate the existing research on RS-ML applications in railway inspection. The SLR meticulously compiled and analyzed relevant studies, evaluating the evolution of research trends, methodological approaches, and the geographic distribution of contributions. The findings showed a notable increase in relevant research activity over the last five years, highlighting the growing interest in this realm. The key methodological patterns emphasize the predominance of approaches based on convolutional neural networks, a variant of artificial neural networks, in achieving high levels of precision. These findings serve as a foundational resource for academics, researchers, and practitioners in the fields of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, engineering, and transportation to help guide future research directions and foster the development of more efficient, accurate, and cost-effective railway inspection methods."

                "In the age of information technology and the additional computational search tools and software available, this systematic review aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets for obesity, evaluated in silico and subsequently validated in vivo. The systematic review was initially guided by the research question “What therapeutic targets have been used in in silico analysis for the treatment of obesity?” and structured based on the acronym PECo (P, problem; E, exposure; Co, context). The systematic review protocol was formulated and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022353808) in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items Checklist for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P), and the PRISMA was followed for the systematic review. The studies were selected according to the eligibility criteria, aligned with PECo, in the following databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of <em>Science</em>, BVS, and EMBASE. The search strategy yielded 1142 articles, from which, based on the evaluation criteria, 12 were included in the systematic review. Only seven these articles allowed the identification of both in silico and in vivo reassessed therapeutic targets. Among these targets, five were exclusively experimental, one was exclusively theoretical, and one of the targets presented an experimental portion and a portion obtained by modeling. The predominant methodology used was molecular docking and the most studied target was Human Pancreatic Lipase (HPL) (n = 4). The lack of methodological details resulted in more than 50% of the papers being categorized with an “unclear risk of bias” across eight out of the eleven evaluated criteria. From the current systematic review, it seems evident that integrating in silico methodologies into studies of potential drug targets for the exploration of new therapeutic agents provides an important tool, given the ongoing challenges in controlling obesity."

                "Background: The aging population is steadily increasing, posing new challenges and opportunities for healthcare systems worldwide. Technological advancements, particularly in commercially available Active Assisted Living devices, offer a promising alternative. These readily accessible products, ranging from smartwatches to home automation systems, are often equipped with Artificial Intelligence capabilities that can monitor health metrics, predict adverse events, and facilitate a safer living environment. However, there is no review exploring how Artificial Intelligence has been integrated into commercially available Active Assisted Living technologies, and how these devices monitor health metrics and provide healthcare solutions in a real-world environment for healthy aging. This review is essential because it fills a knowledge gap in understanding AI's integration in Active Assisted Living technologies in promoting healthy aging in real-world settings, identifying key issues that require to be addressed in future studies. Objective: The aim of this overview is to outline current understanding, identify potential research opportunities, and highlight research gaps from published studies regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence in commercially available Active Assisted Living technologies that assists older individuals aging at home. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in six databases—PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Web of <em>Science</em>—to identify relevant studies published over the past decade from 2013 to 2024. Our methodology adhered to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews to ensure rigor and transparency throughout the review process. After applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria on 825 retrieved articles, a total of 64 papers were included for analysis and synthesis. Results: Several trends emerged from our analysis of the 64 selected papers. A majority of the work (39/64, 61%) was published after the year 2020. Geographically, most of the studies originated from East Asia and North America (36/64, 56%). The primary application goal of Artificial Intelligence in the reviewed literature was focused on activity recognition (34/64, 53%), followed by daily monitoring (10/64, 16%). Methodologically, tree-based and neural network-based approaches were the most prevalent Artificial Intelligence algorithms used in studies (32/64, 50% and 31/64, 48% respectively). A notable proportion of the studies (32/64, 50%) carried out their research using specially designed smart home testbeds that simulate the conditions in real-world. Moreover, ambient technology was a common thread (49/64, 77%), with occupancy-related data (such as motion and electrical appliance usage logs) and environmental sensors (indicators like temperature and humidity) being the most frequently used. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Artificial Intelligence has been increasingly deployed in the real-world Active Assisted Living context over the past decade, offering a variety of applications aimed at healthy aging and facilitating independent living for the older adults. A wide range of smart home indicators were leveraged for comprehensive data analysis, exploring and enhancing the potentials and effectiveness of solutions. However, our review has identified multiple research gaps that need further investigation. First, most research has been conducted in controlled testbed environments, leaving a lack of real-world applications that could validate the technologies' efficacy and scalability. Second, there is a noticeable absence of research leveraging cloud technology, an essential tool for large-scale deployment and standardized data collection and management. Future work should prioritize these areas to maximize the potential benefits of Artificial Intelligence in Active Assisted Living settings."

                "Usually, screening (mostly mammography) is used by radiologists to manually detect breast cancer. The likelihood of identifying suspected cases as false positives or false negatives is significant, contingent on the experience of the radiologist and the kind of imaging screening device/method utilized. The confirmation of the type of tumour seen by the radiologist is sent for histological investigation (microscopic analysis) through a biopsy, where the tumor's grade and stage, which are used in the latter stages of treatment, are ascertained through biopsy. However, a secondary issue with the cancer detection process is that only 15 to 30% of instances that are referred for biopsy result in malignant findings. Since deep learning demonstrated remarkable performance in visual recognition challenges, it has been widely applied to a variety of tasks. Similar examples include deep learning applications in healthcare, which are gaining a lot of interest from the research community. Deep learning is used to identify, categories tumours, and breast cancer is a significant global health concern. The medical <em>sciences</em> could now make more accurate diagnoses and detections due to recent advancements in machine learning techniques. Hence due to systems potential accuracy, it could offer optimistic outcomes when used to read malignant images. In imaging domains, deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable success in constituent segmentation (UNet), localization (DenseNet), and classification (VGG-19). This study examines, how deep learning methods are assisting in the highly accurate diagnosis of benign or malignant tumours based on screened images. In contrast to a mammogram, which is covered in detail, this paper briefly discusses imaging methods for cancer detection. Early detection and cost effectiveness are two main benefits of applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to mammograms."

                "This article explores the impact of automation on environmental sensing, focusing on advanced technologies that revolutionize data collection analysis and monitoring. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines automation as integrating hardware and software components into modern analytical systems. Advancements in electronics, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, and robotics drive the evolution of automated sensing systems, overcoming traditional limitations in manual data collection. Environmental sensor networks (ESNs) address challenges in weather constraints and cost considerations, providing high-quality time-series data, although issues in interoperability, calibration, communication, and longevity persist. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), particularly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), play an important role in environmental monitoring due to their versatility and cost-effectiveness. Despite challenges in regulatory compliance and technical limitations, UAVs offer detailed spatial and temporal information. Pollution monitoring faces challenges related to high costs and maintenance requirements, prompting the exploration of cost-efficient alternatives. Smart agriculture encounters hurdle in data integration, interoperability, device durability in adverse weather conditions, and cybersecurity threats, necessitating privacy-preserving techniques and federated learning approaches. Financial barriers, including hardware costs and ongoing maintenance, impede the widespread adoption of smart technology in agriculture. Integrating robotics, notably underwater vehicles, proves indispensable in various environmental monitoring applications, providing accurate data in challenging conditions. This review details the significant role of transfer learning and edge computing, which are integral components of robotics and wireless monitoring frameworks. These advancements aid in overcoming challenges in environmental sensing, underscoring the ongoing necessity for research and innovation to enhance monitoring solutions. Some state-of-the-art frameworks and datasets are analyzed to provide a comprehensive review on the basic steps involved in the automation of environmental sensing applications."

                "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the <em>science</em> fields with huge potential to create a cognitive and tech-leaping type of future smart city design/development. However, extant studies lag behind recent applications, potential growth areas, and the challenges associated with AI implementation. This study examines AI’s current role, trend, and future potential impacts in enhancing smart city drivers. The methodology entails conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of publications from 2022 onwards. The approach involves qualitative deductive coding methods, descriptive statistical analysis, and thematic analysis. The findings revealed the impacts of AI in (i) public services and connectivity, (ii) improving accessibility and efficiency, (iii) quality healthcare, (iv) education, and (v) public safety. Likewise, strategies, such as collaborative ecosystems, digital infrastructure, capacity building, and clear guidelines and ethical framework, were proposed for fostering the integration of AI in potential future smart cities. This research fills a notable gap in the current understanding of AI’s specific contributions to smart cities, offering insights for stakeholders in urban planning, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, sociology, economics, environmental <em>science</em>, and smart city initiatives. It serves as a strategic guideline and scholarly research output for enhancing smart city design. It also underscores the potential of AI in creating dynamic, sustainable, and efficient urban environments."

                "Over the last decade, research on evolving computational thinking (CT) has garnered heightened attention. Assessing the publication tendencies and nucleus contents of investigations on progressing CT to direct future research initiatives, develop policies, and integrate them into instructional materials is timely and exceedingly essential in education. Therefore, this research reviewed publications on progressing CT to identify research trends and core contents published in the Scopus database from 2008 to May 2022. For this reason, this study applied bibliometric and content analysis to 132 selected publications. After examining bibliometrics, the findings indicate a steady increase in publications related to game-based learning (GBL) and CT, reaching a peak in 2021, with the United States emerging as the most prolific contributor in terms of authors, institutions, and countries). The leading country in citations is primarily China. The document that received the most citations is Hsu’s 2018 paper on “<em>Computers</em> and Education”. Analysis of keywords and themes reveals core content tendencies, emphasizing teaching methods and attitudes aimed at improving CT via GBL. These results offer valuable insights for researchers and educators to inform their future work. However, future studies may benefit from including other databases such as Web of <em>Science</em> (WoS) and PubMed, employing alternative bibliometric software like VOSviewer or CiteSpace, as well as collecting data from June 2022."

                "The ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator was proposed by Yager back in 1988 and constitutes a parameterized family of aggregation functions between the minimum and the maximum. The purpose of this paper is to perform a bibliometric review of this aggregation operator during the last 35 years through the Web of <em>Science</em> (WoS) Core Collection database and the Visualization of Similarities (VOS) viewer software. The results show that the OWA operator is an increasingly popular aggregation operator, especially in <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>. The results also allow the assertion that Yager, as expected, is still the most influential and productive author. Moreover, the study reveals that institutions from over 80 countries have contributed to OWA research, highlighting the high presence of Chinese universities and the emergence of Pakistani ones. Other interesting findings are presented to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of the OWA operator literature."

                "Transformer technologies, like generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) are increasingly utilized for understanding diverse social media content. Despite their popularity, there is a notable absence of a systematic literature review on their application in disaster analytics. This study investigates the utilization of transformer-based technology in analyzing social media data for disaster and emergency crisis events. Leveraging a systematic review methodology, 114 related works were collated from popular databases like Web of <em>Science</em> and Scopus. After deduplication and following the exclusion criteria, 53 scholarly articles were analyzed, revealing insights into the geographical distribution of research efforts, trends in publication output over time, publication venues, primary research domains, and prevalently used technology. The results show a significant increase in publications since 2020, with a predominant focus on <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, followed by engineering and decision <em>sciences</em>. The results emphasize that within the realm of social-media-based disaster analytics, BERT was utilized in 29 papers, BERT-based methods were employed in 28 papers, and GPT-based approaches were featured in 4 papers, indicating their predominant usage in the field. Additionally, this study presents a novel classification scheme consisting of 10 distinct categories that thoroughly categorize all existing scholarly works on disaster monitoring. However, the study acknowledges limitations related to sycophantic behavior and hallucinations in GPT-based systems and raises ethical considerations and privacy concerns associated with the use of social media data. To address these issues, it proposes strategies for enhancing model robustness, refining data validation techniques, and integrating human oversight mechanisms."

                "Background: In health research, multimodal omics data analysis is widely used to address important clinical and biological questions. Traditional statistical methods rely on the strong assumptions of distribution. Statistical methods such as testing and differential expression are commonly used in omics analysis. Deep learning, on the other hand, is an advanced <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> technique that is powerful in mining high-dimensional omics data for prediction tasks. Recently, integrative frameworks or methods have been developed for omics studies that combine statistical models and deep learning algorithms. Methods and results: The aim of these integrative frameworks is to combine the strengths of both statistical methods and deep learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy while also providing interpretability and explainability. This review report discusses the current state-of-the-art integrative frameworks, their limitations, and potential future directions in survival and time-to-event longitudinal analysis, dimension reduction and clustering, regression and classification, feature selection, and causal and transfer learning."

                "Background: The aim of this scoping review was to understand the development of robotics and its accuracy in placing dental implants when compared to other forms of guided surgery. Methods: An electronic search was conducted on the electronic databases of PubMed, Cochrane, and <em>Science</em> direct with the following queries: ((robotics) AND (dental implant)) AND (accuracy). The search timeline was between 2017 and 2022. Results: A total of 54 articles were screened for title and abstract, of which 16 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Thirty-one articles were excluded mainly because they were out of topic (not relevant) or not in English. In total, 16 articles were included for analysis. Conclusions: This review thoroughly analyses 5 years of literature concerning the evolution of robotics in dental implant surgery, underscoring the necessity for additional research on nascent technologies reported and a comparative study with static and dynamic systems for clinical efficacy evaluation."

                "Background: In the last decade, long-tail learning has become a popular research focus in deep learning applications in medicine. However, no scientometric reports have provided a systematic overview of this scientific field. We utilized bibliometric techniques to identify and analyze the literature on long-tailed learning in deep learning applications in medicine and investigate research trends, core authors, and core journals. We expanded our understanding of the primary components and principal methodologies of long-tail learning research in the medical field. Methods: Web of <em>Science</em> was utilized to collect all articles on long-tailed learning in medicine published until December 2023. The suitability of all retrieved titles and abstracts was evaluated. For bibliometric analysis, all numerical data were extracted. CiteSpace was used to create clustered and visual knowledge graphs based on keywords. Results: A total of 579 articles met the evaluation criteria. Over the last decade, the annual number of publications and citation frequency both showed significant growth, following a power-law and exponential trend, respectively. Noteworthy contributors to this field include Husanbir Singh Pannu, Fadi Thabtah, and Talha Mahboob Alam, while leading journals such as IEEE ACCESS, <em>COMPUTERS</em> IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, and COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS have emerged as pivotal platforms for disseminating research in this area. The core of long-tailed learning research within the medical domain is encapsulated in six principal themes: deep learning for imbalanced data, model optimization, neural networks in image analysis, data imbalance in health records, CNN in diagnostics and risk assessment, and genetic information in disease mechanisms. Conclusion: This study summarizes recent advancements in applying long-tail learning to deep learning in medicine through bibliometric analysis and visual knowledge graphs. It explains new trends, sources, core authors, journals, and research hotspots. Although this field has shown great promise in medical deep learning research, our findings will provide pertinent and valuable insights for future research and clinical practice."

                "Research in augmented and virtual reality in congregation with the Internet of Things has opened many avenues in diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. Augmented reality permits inserting virtual content in the real world, while virtual reality is a simulated experience that provides an artificial three-dimensional environment to the user. These are the game-changer technologies as they give a transformational change to existing technologies and methods. Augmented and virtual reality has come out as a significant technology in treating various mental disorders, thereby providing great applications in the field of neuroscience. In this review, we shed light on different components required for developing an augmented and virtual reality-based technology followed by different devices used in the augmented and virtual-reality-based systems. We highlighted the use of this technology in the diagnosis of neurological defects and proposed strategies to use these advancements to provide an immersive experience for both research and educational purposes. Moreover, we show an extensive implementation of augmented and virtual reality in neurological surgery, neuromodulation, and neuroprosthetics. Therefore, the role of the Internet of Things with augmented and virtual reality for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders is the future."

                "Heart sound signal analysis is very important for the early identification and treatment of cardiovascular illness. With rapid advancements in <em>science</em> and technology, artificial intelligence technologies are providing tremendous opportunities to enhance diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Instruments can now perform clinical diagnoses that previously could only be handled by human experts more conveniently and efficiently. Despite multiple works on automatic heart sound analysis, there are few summarization and review works. This article attempts to give a thorough overview of various heart sound analysis subtasks and examine the improvements made in each subtask by both machine learning techniques and deep learning algorithms. It goals to highlight the potential of AI to revolutionize cardiovascular healthcare by enabling accurate and automated analysis of heart sounds. The findings of this review are beneficial for researchers, clinicians, and engineers in the development and application of AI-based solutions for improved heart sound classification and diagnosis."

                "The standard three-tier approach for patentability (i.e., novelty, inventive step, industrial applicability) as provided in the World Trade Organization's (WTO) agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) is well-documented in the national laws and legal frameworks of most of the TRIPs member countries; nonetheless exclusion of certain inventions from patent-eligible subject matter under TRIPs agreement (such as scientific theories or mathematical methods, abstract ideas, laws of nature, natural phenomenon, business methods, programs for <em>computers</em>, and diagnostic methods) has been implemented by different member states, differently. Evolution of ever-new technologies in biological and <em>computer</em> <em>sciences</em> has created the need for pushing the boundaries of patent-eligible subject matters through revisiting the existing laws and approaches on the subject. Currently, big data <em>science</em>, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML)-assisted innovations involving use of genetic, mathematical, and other optimization algorithms are at the forefront of the technology revolution. Use of AI/ML and the concept of deep learning (neural networks) in accelerating innovations and incentivizing further innovations in the digital healthcare ecosystem (personalized therapies), transformation of clinical trials, and other biomedical applications has substantially disrupted the conventional corporate approaches to patent-eligible subject matter. This article systematically reviews and discusses the subject matter eligibility standards set by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and European Patent Office (EPO), policies and the judicial decisions providing a guiding framework for analyzing eligibility, and anatomy of patent claims for AI/ML-powered innovations. The article concludes that patent laws create a balance between the two opposing and risky ends of under- and over-protection of inventions. Following the USPTO and EPO guidelines, technology owners may get protection of their technological innovations without creating patent thickets and/or restricting the free flow of technical information generated through AI/ML systems."

                "Marine ecosystems and their fish habitats are becoming increasingly important due to their integral role in providing a valuable food source and conservation outcomes. Due to their remote and difficult to access nature, marine environments and fish habitats are often monitored using underwater cameras to record videos and images for understanding fish life and ecology, as well as for preserve the environment. There are currently many permanent underwater camera systems deployed at different places around the globe. In addition, there exists numerous studies that use temporary cameras to survey fish habitats. These cameras generate a massive volume of digital data, which cannot be efficiently analysed by current manual processing methods, which involve a human observer. Deep Learning (DL) is a cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology that has demonstrated unprecedented performance in analysing visual data. Despite its application to a myriad of domains, its use in underwater fish habitat monitoring remains under explored. In this paper, we provide a tutorial that covers the key concepts of DL, which help the reader grasp a high-level understanding of how DL works. The tutorial also explains a step-by-step procedure on how DL algorithms should be developed for challenging applications such as underwater fish monitoring. In addition, we provide a comprehensive survey of key deep learning techniques for fish habitat monitoring including classification, counting, localisation, and segmentation. Furthermore, we survey publicly available underwater fish datasets, and compare various DL techniques in the underwater fish monitoring domains. We also discuss some challenges and opportunities in the emerging field of deep learning for fish habitat processing. This paper is written to serve as a tutorial for marine scientists who would like to grasp a high-level understanding of DL, develop it for their applications by following our step-by-step tutorial, and see how it is evolving to facilitate their research efforts. At the same time, it is suitable for <em>computer</em> scientists who would like to survey state-of-the-art DL-based methodologies for fish habitat monitoring."

                "Imaging spectroscopy integrates traditional <em>computer</em> vision and spectroscopy into a single system and has gained widespread acceptance as a non-destructive scientific instrument for a wide range of applications. The current state of imaging spectroscopy spans diverse applications including but not limited to air-borne and ground-based <em>computer</em> vision systems. This paper presents the current state of research and industrial applications including precision agriculture, material classification, medical <em>science</em>, forensic <em>science</em>, face recognition and document image analysis, environment monitoring, and remote sensing, which can be aided through imaging spectroscopy. In this regard, we further discuss a comprehensive list of applications of imaging spectroscopy, pre-processing techniques, and spectral image acquisition systems. Likewise, publicly available databases and current software tools for spectral data analysis are also documented in this review. This review paper, therefore, could potentially serve as a reference and roadmap for people looking for literature, databases, applications, and tools to undertake additional research in imaging spectroscopy."

                "As Guest editors, we have appreciated the opportunity to engage with a variety of authors working within the realm of Art and Artificial Intelligence (art+AI). The process of guest editing this special issue has expanded our consideration from three different professional stances. Campbell watches an art and design campus that hesitantly considers artificial intelligence as a possible contribution to artistic practice, while tracking a growing AI competence brewing with enthusiasm in a <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> department on a campus next door. Hedley considers artificial intelligence for its potential in facilitating 3-D geographic visualization, 3-D spatial interfaces, and 3-D data surveying as he considers AI methods to make progress on geographic challenges, while considering the art of designing of user interfaces intended to communicate knowledge. Hertzmann develops <em>computer</em> graphics and vision algorithms, and writes about how they interact with the worlds of art and perception."

                "Generative AI is rapidly transforming the frontier of research in computational structural biology. Indeed, recent successes have substantially advanced protein design and drug discovery. One of the key methodologies underlying these advances is diffusion models (DM). Diffusion models originated in <em>computer</em> vision, rapidly taking over image generation and offering superior quality and performance. These models were subsequently extended and modified for uses in other areas including computational structural biology. DMs are well equipped to model high dimensional, geometric data while exploiting key strengths of deep learning. In structural biology, for example, they have achieved state-of-the-art results on protein 3D structure generation and small molecule docking. This review covers the basics of diffusion models, associated modeling choices regarding molecular representations, generation capabilities, prevailing heuristics, as well as key limitations and forthcoming refinements. We also provide best practices around evaluation procedures to help establish rigorous benchmarking and evaluation. The review is intended to provide a fresh view into the state-of-the-art as well as highlight its potentials and current challenges of recent generative techniques in computational structural biology. This article is categorized under: Data <em>Science</em> > Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Structure and Mechanism > Molecular Structures Software > Molecular Modeling."

                "Radiofrequency (RF) coils for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications serve to generate RF fields to excite the nuclei in the sample (transmit coil) and to pick up the RF signals emitted by the nuclei (receive coil). For the purpose of optimizing the image quality, the performance of RF coils has to be maximized. In particular, the transmit coil has to provide a homogeneous RF magnetic field, while the receive coil has to provide the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thus, particular attention must be paid to the coil simulation and design phases, which can be performed with different <em>computer</em> simulation techniques. Being largely used in many sectors of engineering and <em>sciences</em>, machine learning (ML) is a promising method among the different emerging strategies for coil simulation and design. Starting from the applications of ML algorithms in MRI and a short description of the RF coil’s performance parameters, this narrative review describes the applications of such techniques for the simulation and design of RF coils for MRI, by including deep learning (DL) and ML-based algorithms for solving electromagnetic problems."

                "Applying <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL), and <em>computer</em> vision (CV) on digital image data can help monitor and preserve cultural heritage (CH) sites. Defects such as weathering, removal of mortar, joint damage, discoloration, erosion, surface cracks, vegetation, seepage, and vandalism and their propagation with time adversely affect the structural health of CH sites. Several studies have reported damage detection in concrete and bridge structures using AI techniques. However, few studies have quantified defects in CH structures using the AI paradigm, and limited case studies exist for their applications. Hence, the application of AI-assisted visual inspections for CH sites needs to be explored. AI-assisted digital inspections assist inspection professionals and increase confidence levels in the damage assessment of CH buildings. This review summarizes the damage assessment techniques using image processing techniques, focusing mainly on DL techniques applied for CH conservation. Several case study applications of CH buildings are presented where AI can assist in traditional visual inspections."

                "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have rapidly emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic and diverse data across various domains, including <em>computer</em> vision and other applied areas, since their inception in 2014. Consisting of a discriminative network and a generative network engaged in a minimax game, GANs have revolutionized the field of generative modeling. In February 2018, GAN secured the leading spot on the ‘Top Ten Global Breakthrough Technologies List’ issued by the Massachusetts <em>Science</em> and Technology Review. Over the years, numerous advancements have been proposed, leading to a rich array of GAN variants, such as conditional GAN, Wasserstein GAN, cycle-consistent GAN, and StyleGAN, among many others. This survey aims to provide a general overview of GANs, summarizing the latent architecture, validation metrics, and application areas of the most widely recognized variants. We also delve into recent theoretical developments, exploring the profound connection between the adversarial principle underlying GAN and Jensen-Shannon divergence while discussing the optimality characteristics of the GAN framework. The efficiency of GAN variants and their model architectures will be evaluated along with training obstacles as well as training solutions. In addition, a detailed discussion will be provided, examining the integration of GANs with newly developed deep learning frameworks such as transformers, physics-informed neural networks, large language models, and diffusion models. Finally, we reveal several issues as well as future research outlines in this field."

                "Human–robot interaction (HRI) has escalated in notability in recent years, and multimodal communication and control strategies are necessitated to guarantee a secure, efficient, and intelligent HRI experience. In spite of the considerable focus on multimodal HRI, comprehensive disquisitions delineating various modalities and intricately analyzing their combinations remain elusive, consequently limiting holistic understanding and future advancements. This article aspires to bridge this inadequacy by conducting a profound exploration of multimodal HRI, predominantly concentrating on four principal modalities: vision, auditory and language, haptics, and physiological sensing. An extensive review encapsulating algorithmic dissection, interface devices, and applicative dimensions forms part of this discourse. This manuscript distinctively combines multimodal HRI with cognitive <em>science</em>, deeply probing into the three dimensions, perception, cognition, and action, thereby demystifying algorithms intrinsic to multimodal HRI. Finally, it accentuates the empirical challenges and contours preemptive trajectories for multimodal HRI in human-centric smart manufacturing."

                "Deep Learning (DL) has been effectively utilized in various complicated challenges in healthcare, industry, and academia for various purposes, including thyroid diagnosis, lung nodule recognition, <em>computer</em> vision, large data analytics, and human-level control. Nevertheless, developments in digital technology have been used to produce software that poses a threat to democracy, national security, and confidentiality. Deepfake is one of those DL-powered apps that has lately surfaced. So, deepfake systems can create fake images primarily by replacement of scenes or images, movies, and sounds that humans cannot tell apart from real ones. Various technologies have brought the capacity to change a synthetic speech, image, or video to our fingers. Furthermore, video and image frauds are now so convincing that it is hard to distinguish between false and authentic content with the naked eye. It might result in various issues and ranging from deceiving public opinion to using doctored evidence in a court. For such considerations, it is critical to have technologies that can assist us in discerning reality. This study gives a complete assessment of the literature on deepfake detection strategies using DL-based algorithms. We categorize deepfake detection methods in this work based on their applications, which include video detection, image detection, audio detection, and hybrid multimedia detection. The objective of this paper is to give the reader a better knowledge of (1) how deepfakes are generated and identified, (2) the latest developments and breakthroughs in this realm, (3) weaknesses of existing security methods, and (4) areas requiring more investigation and consideration. The results suggest that the Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) methodology is the most often employed DL method in publications. According to research, the majority of the articles are on the subject of video deepfake detection. The majority of the articles focused on enhancing only one parameter, with the accuracy parameter receiving the most attention. This article is categorized under: Technologies > Machine Learning Algorithmic Development > Multimedia Application Areas > <em>Science</em> and Technology."

                "Feature selection algorithms are frequently employed in preprocessing machine learning pipelines applied to biological data to identify relevant features. The use of feature selection in gene expression studies began at the end of the 1990s with the analysis of human cancer microarray datasets. Since then, gene expression technology has been perfected, the Human Genome Project has been completed, new microarray platforms have been created and discontinued, and RNA-seq has gradually replaced microarrays. However, most feature selection methods in the last two decades were designed, evaluated, and validated on the same datasets from the microarray technology's infancy. In this review of over 1200 publications regarding feature selection and gene expression, published between 2010 and 2020, we found that 57% of the publications used at least one outdated dataset, 23% used only outdated data, and 32% did not cite data sources. Other issues include referencing databases that are no longer available, the slow adoption of RNA-seq datasets, and bias toward human cancer data, even for methods designed for a broader scope. In the most popular datasets, some being 23 years old, mislabeled samples, experimental biases, distribution shifts, and the absence of classification challenges are common. These problems are more predominant in publications with <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> backgrounds compared to publications from biology and can lead to inaccurate and misleading biological results.

                "Background: The recent advances in machine translation (MT) offer an appealing and low-cost solution to overcome language barriers in multiple contexts (e.g., travelling, cultural interaction, digital content localisation). However, highly-technical domains typically exhibiting as long, complex, and specialised texts as the healthcare sector, pose multiple challenges to the effective and risk-safe use of MT. Methods: To examine how MT nowadays assists written/verbal health communication and because of the existing considerable heterogeneity in technological enablers, language pairs and user groups, training approaches, evaluation processes, and users” requirements, we propose in this paper a methodological multi-criteria literature review based on current guidelines in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> research and grounded on a customised configuration of the PRISMA methodology, normally used to perform meta-analyses on clinical trials. The review focuses on language-to-language medical MT, covers the time period January 2015–February 2023, and only refers to articles written in English that are accessible via four scientific online digital libraries. Articles are ranked according to a meta-evaluation scoring method for MT scientific credibility along with a scoring for assessing the scope of MT in healthcare. Finally, a guideline to properly design a study about MT in healthcare is also proposed. Results: The review included a final set of 58 articles from journals (n=30) and conference proceedings (n=28), considering 48 different language combinations. We identified a predominance of English-to-Spanish (n=19) and English-to-Chinese (n=16) implementations, mainly tailored to medical staff only (n=14) or along with patients (n=12). Included papers addressed clinical communication (n=21) and health education (n=37). Unidirectional real-time bilingual MT (n=24) was the most frequent configuration. MT implementations were dominated by Google Translate (n=22) often used as baseline, OpenNMT (n=12), or Moses (n=11). Training and evaluation approaches varied considerably, while deployment and pre-/post-editing were rarely described with an adequate level of detail. Conclusion: Even if a significant number of articles reported that the proposed MT solutions were effective when translating (bio)medical texts, only a subset of them complied with rigorous translation quality assessment criteria (e.g., use of automatic metrics better related to human ranking than BLEU or statistical significance testing). Nevertheless, MT can be a valid support/supplement in health communication but to cope with issues in fluency, accuracy, unnatural translations, domain-adequacy, and potential safety risks (for highly-sensitive documents), appropriate MT training is essential, along with in-domain human post-editing. The presence of in-domain training text corpora has also proven to be beneficial. Finally, guidelines about how to design studies on MT in healthcare are also proposed to engage more researchers in this field."

                "Analyzing and modeling the constitutive behavior of materials is a core area in materials <em>sciences</em> and a prerequisite for conducting numerical simulations in which the material behavior plays a central role. Constitutive models have been developed since the beginning of the 19th century and are still under constant development. Besides physics-motivated and phenomenological models, during the last decades, the field of constitutive modeling was enriched by the development of machine learning-based constitutive models, especially by using neural networks. The latter is the focus of the present review paper, which aims to give an overview of neural networks-based constitutive models from a methodical perspective. The review summarizes and compares numerous conceptually different neural networks-based approaches for constitutive modeling including neural networks used as universal function approximators, advanced neural network models and neural network approaches with integrated physical knowledge. The upcoming of these methods is in-turn closely related to advances in the area of <em>computer</em> <em>sciences</em>, what further adds a chronological aspect to this review. We conclude the review paper with important challenges in the field of learning constitutive relations that need to be tackled in the near future."

                "Recommender systems can strongly influence which information we see online, e.g., on social media, and thus impact our beliefs, decisions, and actions. At the same time, these systems can create substantial business value for different stakeholders. Given the growing potential impact of such AI-based systems on individuals, organizations, and society, questions of fairness have gained increased attention in recent years. However, research on fairness in recommender systems is still a developing area. In this survey, we first review the fundamental concepts and notions of fairness that were put forward in the area in the recent past. Afterward, through a review of more than 160 scholarly publications, we present an overview of how research in this field is currently operationalized, e.g., in terms of general research methodology, fairness measures, and algorithmic approaches. Overall, our analysis of recent works points to certain research gaps. In particular, we find that in many research works in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, very abstract problem operationalizations are prevalent and questions of the underlying normative claims and what represents a fair recommendation in the context of a given application are often not discussed in depth. These observations call for more interdisciplinary research to address fairness in recommendation in a more comprehensive and impactful manner."

                "Objectives The objective of this analysis is to present a current view of the field of ophthalmology and vision research and artificial intelligence (AI) from topical and geographical perspectives. This will clarify the direction of the field in the future and aid clinicians in adapting to new technological developments. Methods A comprehensive search of four different databases was conducted. Statistical and bibliometric analysis were done to characterise the literature. Softwares used included the R Studio bibliometrix package, and VOSviewer. Results A total of 3939 articles were included in the final bibliometric analysis. Diabetic retinopathy (391, 6% of the top 100 keywords) was the most frequently occurring indexed keyword by a large margin. The highest impact literature was produced by the least populated countries and in those countries who collaborate internationally. This was confirmed via a hypothesis test where no correlation was found between gross number of published articles and average number of citations (p value=0.866, r=0.038), while graphing ratio of international collaboration against average citations produced a positive correlation (r=0.283). Majority of publications were found to be concentrated in journals specialising in vision and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, with this category of journals having the highest number of publications per journal (18.00 publications/journal), though they represented a small proportion of the total journals (<1%). Conclusion This study provides a unique characterisation of the literature at the intersection of AI and ophthalmology and presents correlations between article impact and geography, in addition to summarising popular research topics."

                "Purpose: <em>Computer</em>-assisted instruction (CAI) has been used to combat reading challenges, namely reading accuracy and rate for learners with intellectual, developmental and learning disabilities (IDLD). Whilst most reading CAI effectiveness has been studied in English, other transparent languages have less evidence. This study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of CAI effectiveness for transparent language reading for K-3 learners with IDLD. Design/methodology/approach: This study systematically reviews academic peer-reviewed studies from 2010 to 2023 with either randomised controlled treatment (RCT) or single-case treatments. Articles were searched from the ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ERIC, PsychINFO and <em>Science</em> Direct databases, references and systematic review articles. Reading component skills effect sizes were computed using the random effect sizes model. Findings: 11 RCT studies of reading CAI for transparent languages with 510 learners with IDLD were found. A random effect sizes (Cohen’s d) of CAI on individual reading component skills were d = 0.24, p-value = 0.063 and confidence interval (CI) 95% (−0.068–0.551) for phonics and phonemic awareness d = 0.41, p-value = 0.000 and CI 95% (0.175–0.644). Given an average intervention dosage of 1.8 h weekly for a maximum of 16 weeks, CAI had better retention with d = 1.13, p-value = 0.066 and CI 95%(−0.339–2.588). However, these results must be interpreted with a concern of only using published studies. Originality/value: The study contributes to quantitative CAI effectiveness for transparent language reading components for learners with IDLD."

                "Those working toward equitable K-12 computing education in the United States have always had their work cut out for them: understanding how best to teach, developing robust curricula, designing novel tools, building teacher capacity, and supporting systemic change in schools to bring equitable computing education to young people. Collectively, these areas represent an ambitious and complex set of problems to solve. But current changes to the educational landscape in the United States—where teaching basic ideas about how to critically engage with the world has become deeply politicized, and where forces working toward privatization of education are on the rise—require us to broaden the scope of our work. Our efforts must shift to not just include the aforementioned problems but also include ones that are more explicitly political: engaging in solidarity with the larger project of public education and supporting teachers to have the freedom to teach what students will need to contribute to our society."

                "Digital transformation has become constant and has forced governments to reevaluate the validity of their educational models; therefore, regarding digital and information literacy, to train teachers to improve new digital skills becomes essential. For these reasons, this research will explore the instruction of teachers in digital and information literacy in basic education; likewise, there will be an observation of the research’s theoretical-methodological characteristics related to these variables, and, also, we will carry out an analysis of the most pertinent contributions on the impact of new literacies and competencies in the teaching–learning processes in basic education, with the purpose of obtaining a current state overview of its teacher training within the framework of the technologies’ usage linked to teaching. This review was based on the guidelines of the PRISMA protocol, and to select 56 documents, the Scopus and Web of <em>Science</em> (WoS) databases were used. The results show that, in the Scopus database, Spain is the country with the most research on the subject, with 29% of the total, followed by Indonesia, with 6%, and the United States, with 4%, and that the articles focus mainly on the social <em>sciences</em> and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. Likewise, in WoS, the country with the most research on the subject is Spain, with 30%, followed by Russia, with 10%, and Norway, with 8%, and the articles mainly revolve around the categories of education and communication. The research related to this topic uses a quantitative approach in 68%, a qualitative approach in 25% and a mixed approach in 7%. It was shown that there is a direct relationship between digital and information literacy and digital competency. In addition, it is also emphasized that digital and information literacy are continuous and long-term processes. More didactic proposals on digital skills would be necessary, over government policies and efforts, to achieve a community with a high level of digital and information literacy."

                "In the ever-evolving landscape of tomographic imaging algorithms, this literature review explores a diverse array of themes shaping the field’s progress. It encompasses foundational principles, special innovative approaches, tomographic implementation algorithms, and applications of tomography in medicine, natural <em>sciences</em>, remote sensing, and seismology. This choice is to show off the diversity of tomographic applications and simultaneously the new trends in tomography in recent years. Accordingly, the evaluation of backprojection methods for breast tomographic reconstruction is highlighted. After that, multi-slice fusion takes center stage, promising real-time insights into dynamic processes and advanced diagnosis. Computational efficiency, especially in methods for accelerating tomographic reconstruction algorithms on commodity PC graphics hardware, is also presented. In geophysics, a deep learning-based approach to ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data inversion propels us into the future of geological and environmental <em>sciences</em>. We venture into Earth <em>sciences</em> with global seismic tomography: the inverse problem and beyond, understanding the Earth’s subsurface through advanced inverse problem solutions and pushing boundaries. Lastly, optical coherence tomography is reviewed in basic applications for revealing tiny biological tissue structures. This review presents the main categories of applications of tomography, providing a deep insight into the methods and algorithms that have been developed so far so that the reader who wants to deal with the subject is fully informed."

                "Bioactive peptides, specific protein fragments with positive health effects, are gaining traction in drug development for advantages like enhanced penetration, low toxicity, and rapid clearance. This comprehensive review navigates the intricate landscape of peptide <em>science</em>, covering discovery to functional characterization. Beginning with a peptidomic exploration of natural sources, the review emphasizes the search for novel peptides. Extraction approaches, including enzymatic hydrolysis, microbial fermentation, and specialized methods for disulfide-linked peptides, are extensively covered. Mass spectrometric analysis techniques for data acquisition and identification, such as liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, untargeted peptide analysis, and bioinformatics, are thoroughly outlined. The exploration of peptide bioactivity incorporates various methodologies, from in vitro assays to in silico techniques, including advanced approaches like phage display and cell-based assays. The review also discusses the structure–activity relationship in the context of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), ACE-inhibitory peptides (ACEs), and antioxidative peptides (AOPs). Concluding with key findings and future research directions, this interdisciplinary review serves as a comprehensive reference, offering a holistic understanding of peptides and their potential therapeutic applications."

                "In the field of <em>computer</em>- and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, enormous progress has been made in recent years based on the recognition of surgical instruments in endoscopic images and videos. In particular, the determination of the position and type of instruments is of great interest. Current work involves both spatial and temporal information, with the idea that predicting the movement of surgical tools over time may improve the quality of the final segmentations. The provision of publicly available datasets has recently encouraged the development of new methods, mainly based on deep learning. In this review, we identify and characterize datasets used for method development and evaluation and quantify their frequency of use in the literature. We further present an overview of the current state of research regarding the segmentation and tracking of minimally invasive surgical instruments in endoscopic images and videos. The paper focuses on methods that work purely visually, without markers of any kind attached to the instruments, considering both single-frame semantic and instance segmentation approaches, as well as those that incorporate temporal information. The publications analyzed were identified through the platforms Google Scholar, Web of <em>Science</em>, and PubMed. The search terms used were “instrument segmentation”, “instrument tracking”, “surgical tool segmentation”, and “surgical tool tracking”, resulting in a total of 741 articles published between 01/2015 and 07/2023, of which 123 were included using systematic selection criteria. A discussion of the reviewed literature is provided, highlighting existing shortcomings and emphasizing the available potential for future developments."

                "Nash equilibrium is one of the most influential solution concepts in game theory. With the development of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and artificial intelligence, there is an increasing demand on Nash equilibrium computation, especially for Internet economics and multi-agent learning. This paper reviews various algorithms computing the Nash equilibrium and its approximation solutions in finite normal-form games from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. For the theoretical part, we classify algorithms in the literature and present basic ideas on algorithm design and analysis. For the empirical part, we present a comprehensive comparison on the algorithms in the literature over different kinds of games. Based on these results, we provide practical suggestions on implementations and uses of these algorithms. Finally, we present a series of open problems from both theoretical and practical considerations."

                "Event sequence data is increasingly available. Many business operations are supported by information systems that record transactions, events, state changes, message exchanges, and similar elements. This observation also applies to various industries, including production, logistics, healthcare, financial services, and education. The variety of application areas explains that techniques for event sequence data analysis have been developed rather independently in different fields of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. Most prominent are contributions from information visualization and from process mining. So far, the contributions from these two fields have neither been compared nor have they been mapped to an integrated framework. Such intransparency is problematic since it bears the risk of opportunities of integration are missed and concepts established in one field are independently reinvented in the other one. In this paper, we develop the Event Sequence Visualization framework (ESeVis) that gives due credit to the traditions of both fields. Our mapping study provides an integrated perspective on both fields and identifies potential for synergies for future research."

In this paper, we review the growing literature applying such methods to economic issues and the social <em>sciences</em>, in which social scientists employ deep learning approaches to utilise image data to retrieve additional information. Typically, image data produce better results than traditional approaches and can provide detailed results and helpful insights to improve society and people’s well-being."

                "Veterinary systems biology is an innovative approach that integrates biological data at the molecular and cellular levels, allowing for a more extensive understanding of the interactions and functions of complex biological systems in livestock and veterinary <em>science</em>. It has tremendous potential to integrate multi-omics data with the support of vetinformatics resources for bridging the phenotype-genotype gap via computational modeling. To understand the dynamic behaviors of complex systems, computational models are frequently used. It facilitates a comprehensive understanding of how a host system defends itself against a pathogen attack or operates when the pathogen compromises the host's immune system. In this context, various approaches, such as systems immunology, network pharmacology, vaccinology and immunoinformatics, can be employed to effectively investigate vaccines and drugs. By utilizing this approach, we can ensure the health of livestock. This is beneficial not only for animal welfare but also for human health and environmental well-being. Therefore, the current review offers a detailed summary of systems biology advancements utilized in veterinary <em>sciences</em>, demonstrating the potential of the holistic approach in disease epidemiology, animal welfare and productivity."

                "In recent times, <em>science</em> education has turned its attention toward computational modeling (CM). While there exists a substantial body of research on CM case design and practical applications, a notable gap exists in systematic reviews of these studies. Although systematic reviews of computational thinking in <em>science</em> classrooms exist, they diverge from the definition of CM, often omitting pertinent articles. This study adhered to the standardized process of systematic literature review, selecting Web of <em>Science</em> (WOS) and Scopus as the databases. It established search keywords and criteria for the inclusion and exclusion of literature. After multiple rounds of screening, this study ultimately obtained 70 works related to CM. For the results, this study begins with an analysis of publication distribution, research popularity trends, research types, and methodologies. Subsequently, it delves into participant profiles, encompassing their geographical distribution, educational levels, and sample sizes. Furthermore, it scrutinizes case types, modeling tools, and the fundamental functionalities within case design. Lastly, it explores the scientific disciplines and student competencies that researchers prioritize in CM’s practical application, along with the evaluation methods, collected data, and core empirical findings. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for future research directions, catalyzing deeper exploration within the field."

                "In recent years, 'Artificial Intelligence (AI)' has become a focal point of discussion. AI music composition, an interdisciplinary field blending <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and musicology, has emerged as a prominent area of research. Despite rapid advancements in AI music creation technology, there remains a dearth of comprehensive surveys addressing the core technologies within this domain. To address this gap, this study conducted a comprehensive search across multiple databases spanning a 23-year period (2000-2023) on the topic of 'AI music composition.' Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standard for literature screening, the study systematically organized the development status, frontier hotspots, and technical evaluations of the field. Drawing from literature data, the study verified Price's Law, Lotka's Law, and Bradford's Law - three scientific productivity laws - while summarizing the current landscape from four perspectives: authors, organizations, countries, and journals. Subsequently, utilizing VOSviewer and CiteSpace, two technical software tools, the study conducted an in-depth analysis consisting of four steps: clustering, time zone, burst words, and high-frequency referenced literature. The study presented the evolution trajectory of frontiers and hotspots through visualization maps. Finally, building upon quantitative statistical insights, the study qualitatively expanded research efforts by organizing and evaluating the latest AI music generation algorithm technologies. The systematic literature analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, aims to furnish researchers and practitioners in related fields with systematic references."

                "This paper presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art motion capture techniques for digital human modeling in sports, including traditional optical motion capture systems, wearable sensor capture systems, <em>computer</em> vision capture systems, and fusion motion capture systems. The review explores the strengths, limitations, and applications of each technique in the context of sports <em>science</em>, such as performance analysis, technique optimization, injury prevention, and interactive training. The paper highlights the significance of accurate and comprehensive motion data acquisition for creating high-fidelity digital human models that can replicate an athlete’s movements and biomechanics. However, several challenges and limitations are identified, such as limited capture volume, marker occlusion, accuracy limitations, lack of diverse datasets, and computational complexity. To address these challenges, the paper emphasizes the need for collaborative efforts from researchers and practitioners across various disciplines. By bridging theory and practice and identifying application-specific challenges and solutions, this review aims to facilitate cross-disciplinary collaboration and guide future research and development efforts in harnessing the power of digital human technology for sports <em>science</em> advancement, ultimately unlocking new possibilities for athlete performance optimization and health."

                "The article addresses the accelerating human–machine interaction using the large language model (LLM). It goes beyond the traditional logical paradigms of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) by considering poor-formalizable cognitive semantical interpretations of LLM. XAI is immersed in a hybrid space, where humans and machines have crucial distinctions during the digitisation of the interaction process. The author’s convergent methodology ensures the conditions for making XAI purposeful and sustainable. This methodology is based on the inverse problem-solving method, cognitive modeling, genetic algorithm, neural network, causal loop dynamics, and eigenform realization. It has been shown that decision-makers need to create unique structural conditions for information processes, using LLM to accelerate the convergence of collective problem solving. The implementations have been carried out during the collective strategic planning in situational centers. The study is helpful for the advancement of explainable LLM in many branches of economy, <em>science</em> and technology."

                "Game theory has been studied extensively in recent centuries as a set of formal mathematical strategies for optimal decision making. This discipline improved its efficiency with the arrival, in the 20th century, of digital <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. However, the computational limitations related to exponential time type problems in digital processors, triggered the search for more efficient alternatives. One of these choices is quantum computing. Certainly, quantum processors seem to be able to solve some of these complex problems, at least in theory. For this reason, in recent times, many research works have emerged related to the field of quantum game theory. In this paper we review the main studies about the subject, including operational requirements and implementation details. In addition, we describe various quantum games, their design strategy, and the used supporting tools. We also present the still open debate linked to the interpretation of the transformations of classical algorithms in fundamental game theory to their quantum version, with special attention to the Nash equilibrium."

                "This study addresses concerns about reproducibility in scientific research, focusing on the use of electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning to estimate mental workload. We established guidelines for reproducible machine learning research using EEG and used these to assess the current state of reproducibility in mental workload modeling. We first started by summarizing the current state of reproducibility efforts in machine learning and in EEG. Next, we performed a systematic literature review on Scopus, Web of <em>Science</em>, ACM Digital Library, and Pubmed databases to find studies about reproducibility in mental workload prediction using EEG. All of this previous work was used to formulate guidelines, which we structured along the widely recognized Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework. By using these guidelines, researchers can ensure transparency and comprehensiveness of their methodologies, therewith enhancing collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the scientific community, and enhancing the reliability, usability and significance of EEG and machine learning techniques in general. A second systematic literature review extracted machine learning studies that used EEG to estimate mental workload. We evaluated the reproducibility status of these studies using our guidelines. We highlight areas studied and overlooked and identify current challenges for reproducibility. Our main findings include limitations on reporting performance on unseen test data, open sharing of data and code, and reporting of resources essential for training and inference processes."

                "Introduction: The use of virtual environments in rehabilitation has been growing. The current systematic review aimed to evaluate how and where virtual technologies are combined with music in rehabilitation. Methods: A literature search was conducted in seven databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> database, Medline, Nursing & Allied Health database, and Scopus). It included articles published from 2006 to February 2023. The search followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for study selection. Twelve studies with 160 participants were included in the review. In addition, a descriptive approach was used to gather data from the studies for the areas of interest. Results: Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality were most familiar and used in rehabilitation, but Mixed Reality, and Extended Reality were less studied. It became evident that equipment, diverse applications, assessment metrics, training environments, and methodologies were highly varied. Most of the studies were pilots, the overall quality of included studies was rated moderate, and the risk of bias was high in the included studies. The studies on motor rehabilitation after stroke showed a clinical improvement in hand functions, specifically fractionation. Furthermore, studies that included motivation, adherence, and mental health, slightly supported the idea that VR technologies with music have the potential to promote motivation and exercise adherence, increase positive emotions, and decrease anxiety. In addition, user experience and feasibility studies presented technologies combined with music to be safe and acceptable in rehabilitation. Discussion: In light of these findings, it can be inferred that virtual technologies with music offer promising avenues for future rehabilitation research. However, some confusion was obtained related to the included studies’ definitions of technologies and management terms. Furthermore, it is important to note the limited number of studies and participants, the heterogeneity among participants, and the overall quality of the studies that restrict the generalizability of these results to a larger population. Therefore, future researchers should define concepts and terms, delve deeper into this area to uncover the potential benefits, and clarify the specific mechanisms through which virtual technologies with music can positively impact rehabilitation outcomes."

                "Background and Context: Although computing is a highly sought-after skill set in our modern economy, certain individuals are under represented in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> (CS) courses and careers. The integration of visual and performing arts in K-12 CS education has been gaining “STEAM” as a viable strategy for making computing more inclusive. Objective: The goal of this review is to increase knowledge and understanding of this approach. Method: We undertook a rapid review of the existing literature using PRISMA’s protocol. Findings: We provide insight into various approaches to K-12 arts+CS instruction, and describe how these approaches have impacted learners’ CS knowledge, skills, and attitudes. We also identify potential obstacles to making arts+CS instruction less inclusive. Implications: We make recommendations for designing, developing, and implementing arts-integrated CS instruction across educational settings, and highlight the importance of increasing the presence of diverse voices and perspectives at this intersection of disciplines."

                "Applied computing utilizes aspects of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> to solve problems in several disciplines, including business, politics, education, and the environment. Occupied in this field, it will likely use a range of programming, graphic applications, networking, software engineering and operating systems management skills to collect, analyze, store, and deliver information that will help resolve issues for individuals, companies, and groups. Applied computing is the study of both applied <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and theoretical. Thought the intersection of information technology, <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, and business, applied computing focuses on technical computing concepts and the occurrence of skills in organizational leadership and business strategy. It can be classified the applied computing skills and knowledge into (Current programming languages and technology, Software engineering, IT security, Mobile technology, Networking, Operating system management, Graphic applications, Data integration, Distributed systems, Communication, Critical thinking, analysis, and problem-solving, Project management). Feasibly the most defining characteristic of applied computing is the ability to assume critically about how to best use their technical skills to problem solve and make a positive impact on the organization. This special issue of Baghdad <em>Science</em> Journal on applied computing provides an overview of applied computing for Current programming languages and technology, Software engineering, IT security, Mobile technology, Networking, by publishing articles on recent research concepts."

                "In 2022, OpenAI's unveiling of generative AI Large Language Models (LLMs)- ChatGPT, heralded a significant leap forward in human-machine interaction through cutting-edge AI technologies. With its surging popularity, scholars across various fields have begun to delve into the myriad applications of ChatGPT. While existing literature reviews on LLMs like ChatGPT are available, there is a notable absence of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and bibliometric analyses assessing the research's multidisciplinary and geographical breadth. This study aims to bridge this gap by synthesising and evaluating how ChatGPT has been integrated into diverse research areas, focussing on its scope and the geographical distribution of studies. Through a systematic review of scholarly articles, we chart the global utilisation of ChatGPT across various scientific domains, exploring its contribution to advancing research paradigms and its adoption trends among different disciplines. Our findings reveal a widespread endorsement of ChatGPT across multiple fields, with significant implementations in healthcare (38.6%), <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>/IT (18.6%), and education/research (17.3%). Moreover, our demographic analysis underscores ChatGPT's global reach and accessibility, indicating participation from 80 unique countries in ChatGPT-related research, with the most frequent countries keyword occurrence, USA (719), China (181), and India (157) leading in contributions. Additionally, our study highlights the leading roles of institutions such as King Saud University, the All India Institute of Medical <em>Sciences</em>, and Taipei Medical University in pioneering ChatGPT research in our dataset. This research not only sheds light on the vast opportunities and challenges posed by ChatGPT in scholarly pursuits but also acts as a pivotal resource for future inquiries. It emphasises that the generative AI (LLM) role is revolutionising every field. The insights provided in this paper are particularly valuable for academics, researchers, and practitioners across various disciplines, as well as policymakers looking to grasp the extensive reach and impact of generative AI technologies like ChatGPT in the global research community."

                "Featured Application: This present systematic review aimed to provide new insights into the development of 3D-printed scaffolds to promote dental implant placement. Background: Regenerative medicine in dentistry involves tissue engineering applications suitable for the unique oral environment. In this regard, advances in <em>computer</em>-aided technology have facilitated the creation of 3D scaffolds using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). This review aimed to investigate whether 3D-printed scaffolds can be effectively used to achieve ridge preservation and/or predictable vertical and horizontal bone augmentation, ensuring successful outcomes for dental implant placement. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across six electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Web of <em>Science</em>, Ovid) to identify relevant studies according to specific eligibility criteria, following the PRISMA guidelines. Two independent reviewers screened and selected studies, performed data extraction, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for randomized clinical trials and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for non-randomized clinical trials. Results: The initial search yielded 419 articles, which were subsequently screened to remove duplicates. After evaluating 293 articles based on title and abstract, 10 studies remained for full-text assessment. Ultimately, only three studies met all the pre-established eligibility criteria. Conclusions: The studies included in this systematic review showed that the use of multidimensional customized scaffolds appears to promote dental implant placement. Nevertheless, despite the positive reported effects, further well-designed randomized clinical trials are necessary to determine the special characteristics of the optimal 3D-customized scaffold."

                "Background: <em>Science</em> teachers' understanding of the roles of computing practices in <em>science</em> frame how they enact scientific computational practices in their teaching and how their students perceive the relationship between computational practices and scientific endeavours. Objectives: This critical, integrative review synthesizes teacher learning literature about the role of computational literacy and computing practices in K-12 <em>science</em> teaching. Methods: We examined 54 peer-reviewed articles and analysed the ways the researchers and teacher participants describe the affordances of integrating computational thinking (CT) and other computational practices in <em>science</em>. We characterize how CT and computational practices are framed in relation to scientific learning goals. We identify six primary affordances for integrating computational practices with <em>science</em> that are conveyed to teachers and by teachers, as represented in these studies of teacher learning. Results and Conclusions: These six perspectives include (1) learning <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> principles, (2) developing CT dispositions, (3) engagement and inclusion in <em>science</em>, (4) taking ownership of <em>science</em>, (5) supporting learning <em>science</em> content, and (6) participating in computational practice as a form of scientific epistemic practice. Our analysis indicates that computational thinking and computational practices are often integrated in <em>science</em> in order to teach something about computing (e.g., Perspective 1), rather than to support learners' scientific work. Only the 29 articles coded for the sixth perspective—that is, in service of epistemic aims in <em>science</em>—demonstrate commitment to students' uses of computational ideas and practices as epistemic tools to participate in the sensemaking work of <em>science</em>. Takeaways: Comparison of Perspectives 5 and 6 illustrates the nuance between computational practices in <em>science</em> that reify something students have already “figured out,” rather than those that serve epistemic goals. Perspective 6 encapsulates the deep synergy among (1) the reflexive nature of computing with scientific ideas and (2) computing as a central practice in <em>science</em> and engineering. We contend that a more focused message of computational practices in service of scientific sensemaking goals is necessary if we expect teachers to enact CT and related computational practices in their classrooms."

                "The liver is an important and multifunctional human organ. Early and accurate diagnosis of a liver tumor can save lives. Computed Tomography (CT) images provide comprehensive information for liver tumor diagnosis using feature extraction techniques. These extracted features help classify liver tumors using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods. For this research, twelve 1hundred CT images were acquired from the Radiology Department of Nishter Medical University & Hospital. The noise was removed using Gabor Filter after converting CT images into grayscale. Image quality was enhanced by adopting Histogram Equalization (HE), and finally, the Image’s edges and boundaries were improved using a smoothening and sharpening algorithm. Preprocessed images were forwarded to extract six features: Histogram, Run-length, Co-occurrence, Autogressive, Gradient, and Wavelet Transform. A major focus of this research is to evaluate that ML methods produced good accuracy using already extracted features while DL Algorithms could not produce better results. Firstly, ML methods such as Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Boost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are deployed using an already extracted feature list containing all six features. It was observed that DT, RF, Boost, and SVM produced 96.5%, 99.6%, 99.7%, and 98.0% classification accuracy. After that, DL Algorithms such as Neural Networks (NN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were deployed. The results showed that NN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and CNN produced 50.0%, 53.0%, 54.0%, and 54.0% accuracy respectively. To validate the major focus of this research, finally, Pre-trained DL Algorithms such as Residual Network 50 (Resnet50), Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) and LSTM + CNN were deployed. Results showed that Resnet50, VGG16, and LSTM + CNN attained 78.0%, 88.0%, and 97.0% accuracy respectively. Hence, ML methods performed better using already extracted features, while DL Algorithms could not produce promising results on these extracted features."

                "The surge in text data has driven extensive research into developing diverse automatic summarization approaches to effectively handle vast textual information. There are several reviews on this topic, yet no large-scale analysis based on quantitative approaches has been conducted. To provide a comprehensive overview of the field, this study conducted a bibliometric analysis of 3108 papers published from 2010 to 2022, focusing on automatic summarization research regarding topics and trends, top sources, countries/regions, institutions, researchers, and scientific collaborations. We have identified the following trends. First, the number of papers has experienced 65% growth, with the majority being published in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> conferences. Second, Asian countries and institutions, notably China and India, actively engage in this field and demonstrate a strong inclination toward inter-regional international collaboration, contributing to more than 24% and 20% of the output, respectively. Third, researchers show a high level of interest in multihead and attention mechanisms, graph-based semantic analysis, and topic modeling and clustering techniques, with each topic having a prevalence of over 10%. Finally, scholars have been increasingly interested in self-supervised and zero/few-shot learning, multihead and attention mechanisms, and temporal analysis and event detection. This study is valuable when it comes to enhancing scholars' and practitioners' understanding of the current hotspots and future directions in automatic summarization. This article is categorized under: Algorithmic Development > Text Mining."

                "Background and context: Coding and computational thinking are often taught through integrated curricula, despite a paucity of classroom-based research on their effectiveness. Objective: To investigate evidence of learning resulting from cross-curricular coding tasks in middle-school classrooms, and the school environment factors that impact upon this. Method: This scoping review synthesises recent empirical research on classroom-based integrated coding curricula in middle schools, and analyses the nature of student learning reported in the studies. Findings: By analysing the way computational thinking has been operationalised, we contend that it conceptually conflates a range of learning outcomes. The analysis also reveals that the quality of student learning is subject to teacher knowledge and pedagogy, which are in turn heavily influenced by factors from multiple levels of school ecosystems. Implications: Future research into integrated coding curricula should address specific outcomes in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, in the integrated subject, and general competencies, and consider school ecosystem factors."

                "Purpose: Nature’s evolution has shaped intelligent behaviors in creatures like insects and birds, inspiring the field of Swarm Intelligence. Researchers have developed bio-inspired algorithms to address complex optimization problems efficiently. These algorithms strike a balance between computational efficiency and solution optimality, attracting significant attention across domains. Design/methodology/approach: Bio-inspired optimization techniques for feature engineering and its applications are systematically reviewed with chief objective of assessing statistical influence and significance of “Bio-inspired optimization”-based computational models by referring to vast research literature published between year 2015 and 2022. Findings: The Scopus and Web of <em>Science</em> databases were explored for review with focus on parameters such as country-wise publications, keyword occurrences and citations per year. Springer and IEEE emerge as the most creative publishers, with indicative prominent and superior journals, namely, PLoS ONE, Neural Computing and Applications, Lecture Notes in <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> and IEEE Transactions. The “National Natural <em>Science</em> Foundation” of China and the “Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology” of India lead in funding projects in this area. China, India and Germany stand out as leaders in publications related to bio-inspired algorithms for feature engineering research. Originality/value: The review findings integrate various bio-inspired algorithm selection techniques over a diverse spectrum of optimization techniques. Anti colony optimization contributes to decentralized and cooperative search strategies, bee colony optimization (BCO) improves collaborative decision-making, particle swarm optimization leads to exploration-exploitation balance and bio-inspired algorithms offer a range of nature-inspired heuristics."

                "Digital <em>computers</em> were invented in the 1940s. They are sophisticated and versatile machines whose functioning is grounded in elaborate theory. Advances in theory and the availability of <em>computers</em> helped <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> to develop as an academic discipline, and university departments for the same started coming up in the 1960s. <em>Computer</em> <em>science</em> covers all phenomenon related to <em>computers</em> and consists primarily of man-made laws governing building, programming, and using <em>computers</em>. Computational thinking is a way of thinking influenced by <em>computers</em> and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. There are two schools of thought on computational thinking. The first school sees computational thinking as the use of <em>computers</em> to explore the world, while the other sees computational thinking as the application of concepts from <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> to solve real-world problems. Scholars typically agree that computational thinking has four essential components, viz., abstraction, decomposition, algorithm design, and generalization. Computational thinking is often feted by <em>computer</em> scientists as a useful skill that can be used by anybody anywhere. However, it is necessary to find out ways for successfully using computational thinking in domains other than <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> before it can be declared a universal skill."

                "The metaverse, a burgeoning virtual reality realm, has garnered substantial attention owing to its multifaceted applications. Rapid advancements and widespread acceptance of metaverse technologies have birthed a dynamic and intricate digital landscape. As various platforms, virtual worlds, and social networks within the metaverse increase, there is a growing imperative for a comprehensive analysis of its implications across societal, technological, and business dimensions. Notably, existing review studies have, for the past decade, primarily overlooked a metaverse-based multidomain approach. A meticulous examination encompassing 207 research studies delves into the technological innovation of the metaverse, elucidating its future trajectory and ethical imperatives. Additionally, the article introduces the term “MetaWarria” to conceptualize potential conflicts arising from metaverse dynamics. The study discerns that healthcare (45%) and education (22%) are pivotal sectors steering metaverse developments, while the entertainment sector (9%) reshapes the corporate landscape. Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a 9% role in enhancing the metaverse's marketing and user experience. Security, privacy, and policy concerns (11%) are addressed due to escalating threats, yielding practical solutions. The analysis underscores the metaverse's profound influence (57%) on the digital realm, a phenomenon accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The article culminates in contemplating the metaverse's role in future warfare and national security, introducing “MetaWarria” as a conceptual framework for such discussions.

                "Nowadays, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems have become so demanding that they find applications in the field of assisted living systems, elderly healthcare systems, smart homes, healthcare monitoring applications, surveillance systems, etc. Due to its increasing demand in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>; machine learning and deep learning have brought a paradigm shift in the area of sensor-based recognition systems. Providing accurate information about individuals is essential in pervasive computing, but human activity detection is challenging due to the complexity and speed of activities, dynamic recording requirements, and diverse application areas. This survey aims to identify the best wearable device and most optimal machine learning algorithms for HAR in terms of classification accuracy, as well as analyze which algorithms are suitable for specific application areas. The recent advances in HAR systems through machine learning and deep learning techniques have been discussed and from this analysis, it has been observed that CNN and RNN-LSTM techniques have achieved maximum classification efficiency of 92-95.78% on the ADL dataset."

                "This paper explores the fusion of data <em>science</em> and cognitive techniques in deciphering the behaviors and emotions of farm animals. The focus is on the strategic application of digital imaging and artificial intelligence to discern subtle behavioral patterns and micro-expressions in livestock, offering a predictive window into their emotional states. The significance of acoustic vocalization analysis in interpreting complex communicative signals and emotional subtleties is highlighted. The work extends to cognitive evaluations, such as mirror tests and bias assessments, revealing higher levels of self-awareness and cognitive abilities in farm animals than previously recognized. Emphasizing the need for a synergistic approach, the paper advocates for melding technological advancements with a deep understanding of animal psychology and behavior. This ensures that technology enhances rather than supplants traditional observational methods in animal welfare. The discussion delves into various methodologies and algorithms that measure cognition, underscoring the pivotal role of cognitive computing in advancing animal welfare. A cautious and informed application of these technologies is proposed, emphasizing their role in augmenting, not undermining, the essential human-animal bond. Ultimately, this critical review calls for an ethical, empathetic, and scientifically grounded integration of cognitive computing into animal welfare practices."

                "Routing techniques (RTs) play a critical role in modern computing systems that use network-on-chip (NoC) communication infrastructure within multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) platforms. RTs contribute greatly to the successful performance of NoC-based MPSoCs due to traffic congestion avoidance, quality-of-service assurance, fault handling and optimisation of power usage. This paper outlines our efforts to catalogue RTs, limitations, recommendations and key challenges associated with these RTs used in NoC-based MPSoC systems for the IoT domain. We utilized the PRISMA method to collect data from credible resources, including IEEE Xplore ®, ScienceDirect, Association for Computing Machinery and Web of <em>Science</em>. Out of the 906 research papers reviewed, only 51 were considered relevant to the investigation on NoC RTs. The study addresses issues related to NoC routing and suggests new approaches for in-package data negotiating. In addition, it gives an overview of the recent research on routing strategies and numerous algorithms that can be used for NoC-based MPSoCs. The literature analysis addresses current obstacles and delineates potential future avenues, recommendations, and challenges analyzing techniques to assess performance utilizing metrics within the TCCM framework."

                "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of the existing literature on social media (SM) use and examine its relationship with various facets of social well-being (SWB). Design/methodology/approach: The study identifies and selects relevant articles using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, wherein 273 articles were identified using the keyword search criteria from 5 databases namely Web of <em>Science</em>, Emerald, Pubmed, Google Scholar and EBSCOhost, and finally, 20 relevant studies were included for this systematic review. In order to provide directions for future research, a thorough profile with the key findings and knowledge gaps is presented. Findings: The majority of the reviewed studies report an increase in the use of SM, especially amongst adolescents, and this suggests a seriously detrimental impact on their SWB in terms of cyberbullying, lifestyle comparison and impact on self-esteem, substance abuse, declined academic performance, fear of missing out (FoMo) and social overload. However, some of the studies reported life satisfaction, a reduction in loneliness and improved social support and belongingness, particularly those focussing on old age people who experience social isolation. The review also affirmed improved job performance and employees’ well-being. These findings vary across various demographic variables and various SM platforms namely Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, WeChat, YouTube, etc. Originality/value: The findings have significant implications for SM researchers, family members and educators concerning promoting appropriate SM use, especially in terms of their SWB. The study also provides various suggestions for future studies and the need to further explore the topic as the field of SM use and SWB is ever-growing."

                "In recent years, some progress has been made in the key technologies of the architecture and systems software for graph processing. Large-scale graph processing has also been widely used in many fields, including scientific computing, machine learning, social networks, intelligent transportation, bioinformatics, etc. However, most real-world graph computations have characteristics such as dynamic changes and complex and diverse application requirements. This poses new demands and challenges for graph processing in terms of basic theory, architecture, and key technologies of systems software. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed a series of graph processing systems and accelerators, which optimize the graph processing process through technologies such as high-performance computing and parallel computing. Furthermore, in order to meet the demands of practical application scenarios, various graph processing frameworks and algorithms are constantly being innovated and optimized, thus enhancing the practical value of graph processing in terms of processing large-scale graph data and improving computational efficiency. We review the research and development status of key technologies in graph processing architecture and systems software, and summarize, compare, analyze the latest progress of research at home and abroad, and select fields closely related to national economy and people’s livelihood in combination with national development strategies and major application requirements. The industry progress of graph processing-related technologies is analyzed and summarized from typical applications. Finally, the future technical challenges and research directions are prospected."

                "As mobile devices have become a central part of our daily lives, they are also becoming increasingly important in research. In the medical context, for example, smartphones are used to collect ecologically valid and longitudinal data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which is mostly implemented through questionnaires delivered via smart notifications. This type of data collection is intended to capture a patient’s condition on a moment-to-moment and longer-term basis. To collect more objective and contextual data and to understand patients even better, researchers can not only use patients’ input via EMA, but also use sensors as part of the Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) approach. In this paper, we examine how researchers have embraced the topic of MCS in the context of EMA through a systematic literature review. This PRISMA-guided review is based on the databases PubMed, Web of <em>Science</em>, and EBSCOhost. It is shown through the results that both EMA research in general and the use of sensors in EMA research are steadily increasing. In addition, most of the studies reviewed used mobile apps to deliver EMA to participants, used a fixed-time prompting strategy, and used signal-contingent or interval-contingent self-assessment as sampling/assessment strategies. The most commonly used sensors in EMA studies are the accelerometer and GPS. In most studies, these sensors are used for simple data collection, but sensor data are also commonly used to verify study participant responses and, less commonly, to trigger EMA prompts. Security and privacy aspects are addressed in only a subset of mHealth EMA publications. Moreover, we found that EMA adherence was negatively correlated with the total number of prompts and was higher in studies using a microinteraction-based EMA ((Formula presented.) EMA) approach as well as in studies utilizing sensors. Overall, we envision that the potential of the technological capabilities of smartphones and sensors could be better exploited in future, more automated approaches."

                "The concept of learning has multiple interpretations, ranging from acquiring knowledge or skills to constructing meaning and social development. Machine Learning (ML) is considered a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and develops algorithms that can learn from data and generalize their judgment to new observations by exploiting primarily statistical methods. The new millennium has seen the proliferation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), a formalism able to reach extraordinary achievements in complex problems such as <em>computer</em> vision and natural language recognition. In particular, designers claim that this formalism has a strong resemblance to the way the biological neurons operate. This work argues that although ML has a mathematical/statistical foundation, it cannot be strictly regarded as a <em>science</em>, at least from a methodological perspective. The main reason is that ML algorithms have notable prediction power although they cannot necessarily provide a causal explanation about the achieved predictions. For example, an ANN could be trained on a large dataset of consumer financial information to predict creditworthiness. The model takes into account various factors like income, credit history, debt, spending patterns, and more. It then outputs a credit score or a decision on credit approval. However, the complex and multi-layered nature of the neural network makes it almost impossible to understand which specific factors or combinations of factors the model is using to arrive at its decision. This lack of transparency can be problematic, especially if the model denies credit and the applicant wants to know the specific reasons for the denial. The model’s “black box” nature means it cannot provide a clear explanation or breakdown of how it weighed the various factors in its decision-making process. Secondly, this work rejects the belief that a machine can simply learn from data, either in supervised or unsupervised mode, just by applying statistical methods. The process of learning is much more complex, as it requires the full comprehension of a learned ability or skill. In this sense, further ML advancements, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning denote encouraging similarities to similar cognitive skills used in human learning."

                "Since its origin in the 1950s, artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved from technological to educational applications. AI is emerging as an essential tool in education. Its integration into education promises the personalization and the globalization of learning. Despite its potential, it is crucial to consider its ethical challenges and uses. This bibliometric study sought to understand the current state of AI in higher education in order to provide a basis for future research. A bibliometric analysis was conducted between 2017 and 2023, using the Scopus database. The query was performed on 23 October 2023 and focused on titles, keywords, and abstracts. A total of 870 articles were found, and their metadata were analyzed after removing incorrect data. VOSviewer software was used to visualize the similarities, and the publications were studied by country, authors, and collaborations. A steady growth in AI studies in higher education was found, highlighting areas such as <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and social <em>sciences</em>. China and the United States led in production and citations. Keywords such as “artificial intelligence”, “chatgpt”, and “machine learning” indicated trends and areas of interest."

                "Having made significant advancements in understanding living organisms at various levels such as genes, cells, molecules, tissues, and pathways, the field of life <em>sciences</em> is now shifting towards integrating these components into the bigger picture to understand their collective behavior. Such a shift of perspective requires a general conceptual framework for understanding complexity in life <em>sciences</em> which is currently elusive, a transition being facilitated by large-scale data collection, unprecedented computational power, and new analytical tools. In recent years, life <em>sciences</em> have been revolutionized with AI methods, and quantum computing is touted to be the next most significant leap in technology. Here, we provide a theoretical framework to orient researchers around key concepts of how quantum computing can be integrated into the study of the hierarchical complexity of living organisms and discuss recent advances in quantum computing for life <em>sciences</em>. This article is categorized under: Data <em>Science</em> > Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Quantum Computing > Algorithms Structure and Mechanism > Computational Biochemistry and Biophysics."

                "Starting from the contribution of such thinkers as the famous Giordano Bruno (1583) and the great mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré (1889) and the surprising discovery of the meteorologist Edward Lorenz (1963), we consider the expansion of the mathematics of chaos in this article, paying attention to topology, qualitative geometry, and Catastrophe Theory, on the one hand, and addressing the possibilities derived from the new <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em> as Quantum Algorithms and the advances in Artificial Intelligence, on the other. We especially highlight the section on computing chaos, which we consider to be new calculation and analysis instruments, such as machine learning and its algorithm called reservoir computing, through which we can know the dynamics of a chaotic system. With past data, with equations like Karamoto–Sivashinsky, one can improve predictions of the system eight times further ahead than in previous methods. Integrating the machine learning approach and traditional model-based prediction, one could obtain accurate predictions twelve Lyapunov times. As we know, in the framework of chaos theory, it is habitually accepted that the idea of long-term prediction seems impossible because we live under a veil of uncertainty. But with technological advances, the landscape begins to change, both in chaos theory and in its applications, especially in the field of economics, to which we devote particular attention, carrying out as an example the analysis of the evolution of the Madrid Stock Exchange in the 2006–2013 crisis. Above all this, a reflection of a general nature is necessary to enlighten us on the possibility of opening a new horizon."

                "Researchers increasingly turn to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze omics data and gain insights into the underlying biological processes. Yet, given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, many findings have only been shared in their respective research community. An overview of XAI for omics data is needed to highlight promising approaches and help detect common issues. Toward this end, we conducted a systematic mapping study. To identify relevant literature, we queried Scopus, PubMed, Web of <em>Science</em>, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and arXiv. Based on keywording, we developed a coding scheme with 10 facets regarding the studies' AI methods, explainability methods and omics data. Our mapping study resulted in 405 included papers published between 2010 and 2023. The inspected papers analyze DNA-based (mostly genomic), transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolomic data by means of neural networks, tree-based methods, statistical methods and further AI methods. The preferred post-hoc explainability methods are feature relevance (n = 166) and visual explanation (n = 52), while papers using interpretable approaches often resort to the use of transparent models (n = 83) or architecture modifications (n = 72). With many research gaps still apparent for XAI for omics data, we deduced eight research directions and discuss their potential for the field. We also provide exemplary research questions for each direction. Many problems with the adoption of XAI for omics data in clinical practice are yet to be resolved. This systematic mapping study outlines extant research on the topic and provides research directions for researchers and practitioners."

                "Molecules are complex dynamic objects that can exist in different molecular forms (conformations, tautomers, stereoisomers, protonation states, etc.) and often it is not known which molecular form is responsible for observed physicochemical and biological properties of a given molecule. This raises the problem of the selection of the correct molecular form for machine learning modeling of target properties. The same problem is common to biological molecules (RNA, DNA, proteins)—long sequences where only key segments, which often cannot be located precisely, are involved in biological functions. Multi-instance machine learning (MIL) is an efficient approach for solving problems where objects under study cannot be uniquely represented by a single instance, but rather by a set of multiple alternative instances. Multi-instance learning was formalized in 1997 and motivated by the problem of conformation selection in drug activity prediction tasks. Since then MIL has found a lot of applications in various domains, such as information retrieval, <em>computer</em> vision, signal processing, bankruptcy prediction, and so on. In the given review we describe the MIL framework and its applications to the tasks associated with ambiguity in the representation of small and biological molecules in chemoinformatics and bioinformatics. We have collected examples that demonstrate the advantages of MIL over the traditional single-instance learning (SIL) approach. Special attention was paid to the ability of MIL models to identify key instances responsible for a modeling property.

                "This paper reviews the current situation concerning the implementation of game-based learning in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> in primary education, providing insight into current trends, identifying strengths and potential research topics. Articles published in four databases from 2017 to 2021 are included in the analysis and an in-depth analysis of 32 articles is done. Different types of games, implemented in various educational contexts, are presented in these articles. Most of them describe implemented methodology, game-based environment or are evaluating the effectiveness of the created game or the approach. The possibility of implementing a game-based approach while learning other <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> topics or measuring the effectiveness of learning by designing a game as a pedagogical strategy are some areas for future research."

                "Context: Identifying the root cause of a software bug and fixing it is challenging. One reason for this is that many bugs are not reproducible during bug fixing. Objective: We aim to provide an overview of existing works on bug reproduction and localization. We ask four research questions: RQ1: What types of problems have been studied in the area of bug reproduction and localization? RQ2: How are problems studied in previous research? RQ3: What are the main findings and outcomes of previous studies? RQ4: What are the gaps and challenges identified in previous studies? Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study analyzing research literature published between 2011 and 2021. The search for primary studies involved four major <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> digital libraries and resulted in 134 studies for analysis. Results: Regarding RQ1 we found that many studies focus on information retrieval-based approaches to support bug reproduction and localization. Regarding RQ2 we found that bug reports and source code are the typical data sources of bug reproduction and localization. Also, most studies include experiments with historical data but do not investigate ongoing projects. Regarding RQ3 we found that many studies adapt or combine existing approaches for bug reproduction and localization to improve their accuracy or applicability (e.g., combine requirements-related information and bug reports to increase information-retrieval-based techniques). Regarding RQ4 we found that existing solutions for bug reproduction and localization have rarely been integrated into the workflow of developers. Conclusion: Although bug reproduction and localization have been studied in quite some detail, new challenges and gaps emerge due to the evolution of software technologies and practices and the practical needs of software developers. For example, bug reproduction approaches for traditional web applications do not work well with modern “Single Page Web Applications” (SPA) and related technologies, e.g., Angular or React."

                "Various semantic technologies such as ontologies, machine learning, or artificial intelligence-based are being used today with data <em>science</em> for the purpose of explaining the meaning of data, and making this explanation exploitable by <em>computer</em> processing. Although some quick and brief reports do exist, to the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks a detailed study reporting why, when and how semantic technologies are used with data <em>science</em>. This paper is a theoretical review aiming at providing an insight into data <em>science</em> with semantic technologies. We characterize this research topic through a framework called DS2T helping to understand data <em>science</em> with semantic technologies and giving a comprehensive overview of the field through different, but complementary views. The proposed framework may be used to position research studies integrating semantic technologies with data <em>science</em>, compare them, understand new trends, and identify opportunities and open issues related to a given application domain. Software development processes are used as illustration domain."

                "Objective: To provide ideas for the modernization of pulse diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) by comparing and analyzing the current status and trends of modern research on pulse diagnosis in China and abroad, using bibliometric and visualization software. Methods: Modern research literature on pulse diagnosis was searched in China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database from the foundation to May 31, 2023, and in <em>Science</em> Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) from January 1, 2003, to May 31, 2023. After further screening, Microsoft Excel 2019 was used for statistical analysis of publication volume, and CiteSpace (6.1.R6) and VOSviewer (1.6.20) softwares were employed for visual analysis of journals, countries/regions, authors, institutions, keywords, etc. Results: This study included a total of 764 articles in Chinese and 1 459 articles in English. The publication trend of pulse diagnosis research in SCIE database showed an overall fluctuating upward trend, while it exhibited a fluctuating downward trend after 2007 in CNKI database. The volume of English research literature has consistently exceeded that of Chinese literature since 2009. Publications on pulse diagnosis research involved 74 countries/regions. The related journals covered various disciplinary fields, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. The most prolific author in CNKI database was WANG Yiqin (Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine), while the highest number of publications was attributed to ZHANG David (The Hong Kong Polytechnic University) in SCIE database. High-volume institutions in pulse diagnosis research in China and abroad were predominantly TCM research institutions. However, comprehensive universities and other research institutions also made noteworthy contributions. In recent years, hot topics in the modernization of pulse diagnosis research in China included pulse waves, sensors, and artificial intelligence. Foreign research focused on pulse diagnosis systems, sensors, pulse feature extraction, pulse signal analysis, pulse detection, and efficiency of use. Conclusion: Chinese scholars have shown notable participation and emphasis in the modernization research of pulse diagnosis, involving a wide range of disciplinary fields and indicating a characteristic of multidisciplinary cross-fusion development. The hotspots and trends in the modernization of pulse diagnosis research primarily concentrate on the study of pulse condition and signal acquisition, the integration, development, and optimization of various algorithms with pulse diagnosis equipment, and the practical application research of existing objectified outcomes of pulse diagnosis."

                "Usable security involves designing security measures that accommodate users’ needs and behaviors. Balancing usability and security poses challenges: the more secure the systems, the less usable they will be. On the contrary, more usable systems will be less secure. Numerous studies have addressed this balance. These studies, spanning psychology and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>/engineering, contribute diverse perspectives, necessitating a systematic review to understand strategies and findings in this area. This systematic literature review examined articles on usable security from 2005 to 2022. A total of 55 research studies were selected after evaluation. The studies have been broadly categorized into four main clusters, each addressing different aspects: (1) usability of authentication methods, (2) helping security developers improve usability, (3) design strategies for influencing user security behavior, and (4) formal models for usable security evaluation. Based on this review, we report that the field’s current state reveals a certain immaturity, with studies tending toward system comparisons rather than establishing robust design guidelines based on a thorough analysis of user behavior. A common theoretical and methodological background is one of the main areas for improvement in this area of research. Moreover, the absence of requirements for Usable security in almost all development contexts greatly discourages implementing good practices since the earlier stages of development."

                "Brain-machine fusion, also known as hybrid intelligence or brain-<em>computer</em> interface (BCI), is considered one of the most promising technologies of the 21st century. Its potential impact spans a wide range of disciplines, including cognitive <em>science</em>, information <em>science</em>, artificial intelligence, biology, neuroscience, and engineering. The research in this field aims to seamlessly integrate biological intelligence (i.e., the human brain) with machine intelligence (<em>computers</em> or robots) to create a new, powerful form of hybrid intelligence that far surpasses the limitations of current biological and machine intelligence systems. Brain-machine fusion not only signifies the convergence of cutting-edge <em>science</em> and technology but also heralds a new era in which the way humans interact with machines undergoes a profound transformation. The research in this field delves deep into the understanding of human thought processes and cognition, as well as the creation of novel sensory and motor channels to facilitate more natural and intuitive interactions. The scope of brain-machine fusion research extends beyond mere information exchange, encompassing the integration of emotions and motivations. Understanding and interpreting a user's emotional state and motivations are crucial for optimizing the performance of fusion systems, aiding in better meeting user needs and providing more personalized experiences. A key objective is enhancing a user's operational capacity in handling complex tasks. This can encompass highly intricate decision making, problem solving, and task execution, with broad applications in fields, such as healthcare, military, industry, and entertainment. Furthermore, brain-machine fusion necessitates the development of cognitive interaction models that can adapt actively to a user's cognitive characteristics and integrate with machine learning algorithms to achieve personalized adaptability in intelligent systems, thereby enhancing the level of interaction between the user and the system."

                "This special issue will encompass state-of-the-art research on emerging topics related to development and learning in natural and artificial systems. The primary focus of this special issue is to explore the facets of development and learning from a multidisciplinary perspective by convening researchers from the fields of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, robotics, psychology, and developmental studies. We invited researchers to share knowledge and research on how humans and animals develop sensing, reasoning, and actions, and how to exploit robots as research tools to test models of development and learning. We expected the submitted contributions to emphasize the interaction with social and physical environments and how cognitive and developmental capabilities can be transferred to computing systems and robotics. This approach is in harmony with the dual objectives of comprehending human and animal development while leveraging this understanding to enhance future intelligent technologies, particularly for robots that will engage in close interactions with humans."

                "Machine learning and deep learning are two subsets of artificial intelligence that involve teaching <em>computers</em> to learn and make decisions from any sort of data. Most recent developments in artificial intelligence are coming from deep learning, which has proven revolutionary in almost all fields, from <em>computer</em> vision to health <em>sciences</em>. The effects of deep learning in medicine have changed the conventional ways of clinical application significantly. Although some sub-fields of medicine, such as pediatrics, have been relatively slow in receiving the critical benefits of deep learning, related research in pediatrics has started to accumulate to a significant level, too. Hence, in this paper, we review recently developed machine learning and deep learning-based solutions for neonatology applications. We systematically evaluate the roles of both classical machine learning and deep learning in neonatology applications, define the methodologies, including algorithmic developments, and describe the remaining challenges in the assessment of neonatal diseases by using PRISMA 2020 guidelines. To date, the primary areas of focus in neonatology regarding AI applications have included survival analysis, neuroimaging, analysis of vital parameters and biosignals, and retinopathy of prematurity diagnosis. We have categorically summarized 106 research articles from 1996 to 2022 and discussed their pros and cons, respectively. In this systematic review, we aimed to further enhance the comprehensiveness of the study. We also discuss possible directions for new AI models and the future of neonatology with the rising power of AI, suggesting roadmaps for the integration of AI into neonatal intensive care units."

                "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely applied in various domains, including medical image analysis. GANs have been utilized in classification and segmentation tasks, aiding in the detection and diagnosis of diseases and disorders. However, medical image datasets often suffer from insufficiency and imbalanced class distributions. To overcome these limitations, researchers have employed GANs to generate augmented medical images, effectively expanding datasets and balancing class distributions. This review follows the PRISMA guidelines and systematically collects peer-reviewed articles on the development of GAN-based augmentation models. Automated searches were conducted on electronic databases such as IEEE, Scopus, <em>Science</em> Direct, and PubMed, along with forward and backward snowballing. Out of numerous articles, 52 relevant ones published between 2018 and February 2022 were identified. The gathered information was synthesized to determine common GAN architectures, medical image modalities, body organs of interest, augmentation tasks, and evaluation metrics employed to assess model performance. Results indicated that cGAN and DCGAN were the most popular GAN architectures in the reviewed studies. Medical image modalities such as MRI, CT, X-ray, and ultrasound, along with body organs like the brain, chest, breast, and lung, were frequently used. Furthermore, the developed models were evaluated, and potential challenges and future directions for GAN-based medical image augmentation were discussed. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in GAN-based medical image augmentation and emphasizes the potential advantages and challenges associated with GAN utilization in this domain."

                "Quantum networks providing shared entanglement over a mesh of quantum nodes will revolutionize the field of quantum information <em>science</em> by offering novel applications in quantum computation, enhanced precision in networks of sensors and clocks, and efficient quantum communication over large distances. Recent experimental progress with individual neutral atoms demonstrates a high potential for implementing the crucial components of such networks. We highlight latest developments and near-term prospects on how arrays of individually controlled neutral atoms are suited for both efficient remote entanglement generation and large-scale quantum information processing, thereby providing the necessary features for sharing high-fidelity and error-corrected multi-qubit entangled states between the nodes. We describe both the functionality requirements and several examples for advanced, large-scale quantum networks composed of neutral atom processing nodes."

                "This paper presents a literature review on the different aspects of task allocation and assignment problems in human–robot collaboration (HRC) tasks in industrial assembly environments. In future advanced industrial environments, robots and humans are expected to share the same workspace and collaborate to efficiently achieve shared goals. Difficulty- and complexity-aware HRC assembly is necessary for human-centric manufacturing, which is a goal of Industry 5.0. Therefore, the objective of this study is to clarify the definitions of difficulty and complexity used to encourage effective collaboration between humans and robots to leverage the adaptability of humans and the autonomy of robots. To achieve this goal, a systematic review of the following relevant databases for <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> was performed: IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, and ASME Digital Collection. The results extracted from 74 peer-reviewed research articles published until July 2022 were summarized and categorized into four taxonomies for 145 difficulty and complexity definitions from the perspectives of (1) definition-use objectives, (2) evaluation objectives, (3) evaluation factors, and (4) evaluation variables. Next, existing definitions were primarily classified according to the following two criteria to identify potential future studies on the formulation of new definitions for human-centric manufacturing: (1) agent specificity and (2) common aspects in manual and robotic assemblies."

                "Informatics paradigms for brain and mental health research have seen significant advances in recent years. These developments can largely be attributed to the emergence of new technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. Data-driven methods have the potential to support mental health care by providing more precise and personalised approaches to detection, diagnosis, and treatment of depression. In particular, precision psychiatry is an emerging field that utilises advanced computational techniques to achieve a more individualised approach to mental health care. This survey provides an overview of the ways in which artificial intelligence is currently being used to support precision psychiatry. Advanced algorithms are being used to support all phases of the treatment cycle. These systems have the potential to identify individuals suffering from mental health conditions, allowing them to receive the care they need and tailor treatments to individual patients who are mostly to benefit. Additionally, unsupervised learning techniques are breaking down existing discrete diagnostic categories and highlighting the vast disease heterogeneity observed within depression diagnoses. Artificial intelligence also provides the opportunity to shift towards evidence-based treatment prescription, moving away from existing methods based on group averages. However, our analysis suggests there are several limitations currently inhibiting the progress of data-driven paradigms in care. Significantly, none of the surveyed articles demonstrate empirically improved patient outcomes over existing methods. Furthermore, greater consideration needs to be given to uncertainty quantification, model validation, constructing interdisciplinary teams of researchers, improved access to diverse data and standardised definitions within the field. Empirical validation of <em>computer</em> algorithms via randomised control trials which demonstrate measurable improvement to patient outcomes are the next step in progressing models to clinical implementation."

                "As non-renewable cultural heritages, murals have important implications in historical customs, religions, and philosophy as well as their aesthetic values. Recently, many murals are threatened by natural factors and human activities. During the past decades, there are increasing interest in the investigation of murals. Here we review the current status of murals and provide an up-to-date summary of achievements related to murals. The murals that draw the most attention are distributed in Mexico, Ireland, China, and Spain. The aesthetics, history, cultural, educational, and economic values of murals are comprehensively analyzed. The main research technologies used to detect the chemical compositions and physical structures of murals are also summarized. The restoration of murals includes several procedures such as stabilization, repair, surface cleaning, and pigment reconversion. Emerging technologies such as <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> benefit the research and conservation of murals. We also propose that tourism management and climate change should be incorporated into the conservation of murals in the future."

                "In Web 2.0-based social networks, users suffer from authorities of service providers and politicians, such as revoking users, removing content, and selling users’ sensitive information. The concept of decentralized finance (DeFi) as a blockchain-based technology is one of the most popular achievements of blockchain, involving digital assets, smart contracts, protocols, and applications. In the present study, a new subgroup of DeFi is identified known as social finance (SocialFi). It states that social media components can be presented as blockchain-based tokens and SocialFi can be a solution to the definite problems of centralized social media. Therefore, this study addresses the related technologies of SocialFi (e.g., peer-to-peer networks, Web 3.0, decentralized autonomous organizations, and Metaverse) and describes the challenges and opportunities of the next generation of social media. Some main SocialFi challenges reviewed in this study are scalability, regulation, and fake news detection/prevention. Finally, the future direction of this new field in social and <em>computer</em> <em>sciences</em> is discussed."

                "Currently, there is a tendency to use Islamic Geometric Patterns (IGPs) as important identities and cultural elements of building design in the Middle East. Despite high demand, lack of information about the potential of IGPs principles have led to formal inspiration in the design of existing buildings. Many research studies have been carried out on the principles of IGPs. However, comprehensive studies relating to new possibilities, such as structure-based, sustainable-based, and aesthetic-based purposes, developed by <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and related technologies, are relatively rare. This article reviews the state-of-the-art knowledge of IGPs, provides a survey of the main principles, presents the status quo, and identifies gaps in recent research directions. Finally, future prospects are discussed by focussing on different aspects of the principles in accordance with collected evidence obtained during the review process."

                "The evaluation of the semantic similarity of concepts organized according to taxonomies is a long-standing problem in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and has attracted great attention from researchers over the decades. In this regard, the notion of information content plays a key role, and semantic similarity measures based on it are still on the rise. In this review, we address the methods for evaluating the semantic similarity between either concepts or sets of concepts belonging to a taxonomy that, often, in the literature, adopt different notations and formalisms. The results of this systematic literature review provide researchers and academics with insight into the notions that the methods discussed have in common through the use of the same notation, as well as their differences, overlaps, and dependencies, and, in particular, the role of the notion of information content in the evaluation of semantic similarity. Furthermore, in this review, a comparative analysis of the methods for evaluating the semantic similarity between sets of concepts is provided."

                "In recent years, social networks have developed rapidly and have become the main platform for the release and dissemination of fake news. The research on fake news detection has attracted extensive attention in the field of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. Fake news detection technology has made many breakthroughs recently, but many challenges remain. Although there are some review papers on fake news detection, a more detailed picture for carrying out a comprehensive review is presented in this paper. The concepts related to fake news detection, including fundamental theory, feature type, detection technique and detection approach, are introduced. Specifically, through extensive investigation and complex organization, a classification method for fake news detection is proposed. The datasets of fake news detection in different fields are also compared and analyzed. In addition, the tables and pictures summarized here help researchers easily grasp the full picture of fake news detection."

                "Furniture as a functional object must satisfy both artistic and scientific requirements. In particular, ergonomic factors are very important in furniture design in terms of human health and productivity. To make furniture designs at the ideal intersection of <em>science</em> and art, it is necessary to approach furniture design with a scientific systematic. Accordingly, this paper summarizes and analyzes the current state of biomechanics in ergonomic furniture design, covering an overview of the biomechanics utilized in different types of furniture design, biomechanical analysis, and testing methods. In the conclusion of the study, the literature analysis identifies the key topics and areas of future exploration regarding the use of biomechanics in ergonomic furniture design. The findings of the review indicate that (1) the primary studies on biomechanics used in furniture design concentrate on special furniture, such as wheelchairs and transportation vehicle seats, with minimal investigation performed on common furniture; (2) mechanical analysis, experimental testing, and <em>computer</em>-aided ergonomics represent the main techniques applied in furniture design biomechanics; (3) the reliability of biomechanics used in furniture design needs to be improved due to the lack of fundamental parameters of the muscles and skeleton of the human body; and (4) more attention should be paid to the use of biomechanics in the design of common furniture, such as household and office furniture, which affects people’s health and comfort. The scientific and rational application of biomechanics should be integrated into ergonomic furniture design to promote healthy living and enhance work efficiency."

                "Modern 3D <em>computer</em> graphics technologies are able to reproduce the dynamics and appearance of real-world environments and phenomena, building on theoretical models in applied mathematics, statistics and physics. These methods are applied in architectural design and visualization, biological imaging and visual effects. Differentiable methods, instead, aim to determine how graphics outputs (that is, the real-world dynamics or appearance) change when the environment changes. We survey this growing body of work and propose a holistic and unified differentiable visual computing pipeline. Differentiable visual computing can be leveraged to efficiently solve otherwise intractable problems in physical inference, optimal control, object detection and scene understanding, computational design, manufacturing, autonomous vehicles and robotics. Any application that can benefit from an understanding of the underlying dynamics of the real world stands to benefit substantially from a differentiable graphics treatment. We draw parallels between the well-established <em>computer</em> graphics pipeline and a unified differentiable graphics pipeline, targeting consumers, practitioners and researchers. The breadth of fields that these pipelines draw upon—and are of interest to—includes the physical <em>sciences</em>, data <em>sciences</em>, vision and graphics, machine learning, and adjacent mathematical and computing communities."

                "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is widely recognized as a leading cause of blindness among individuals with diabetes worldwide. Therefore, early diagnosis of DR plays a crucial role in preserving patients' vision and halting the progression of the disease to advanced stages. However, manual diagnosis of DR in clinical practice is time-consuming and susceptible to human error, especially during the early stages when the lesions associated with DR are often minute and challenging to identify. Furthermore, with the projected surge in the number of diabetic patients and a concurrent shortage of ophthalmologists, there will be insufficient healthcare professionals available to examine all individuals at risk. The application of machine- and deep learning-based techniques has proven effective in diagnosing medical images, including those related to DR. In this review, we surveyed and analyzed 55 DR grading studies published between 2018 and 2022 extracted from four academic digital libraries: Scopus, Web of <em>Science</em>, Google Scholar, and <em>Science</em> Direct. The review provides a comprehensive discussion and analysis of these selected studies, considering various aspects such as benchmark DR datasets, classification tasks, preprocessing techniques, learning approaches, and performance evaluation measures. Within the literature on DR grading, supervised-based learning techniques have been found to be more prevalent than semi-supervised learning techniques. Furthermore, researchers predominantly addressed this problem as an image-level classification task, overlooking the distinctive characteristics of lesions within each grade. Numerous proposed techniques primarily concentrate on detecting the early stages of DR, while a limited number of studies address the disease's advanced stages. The primary findings of our analysis reveal a potential direction for future research that emphasizes data- and model-centric approaches."

                "Handwriting recognition and analysis has been an active area of research in the last two decades. Handwriting analysis is being studied in various fields of <em>science</em>, such as graphology, neurology, psychology, and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. Furthermore, automated handwriting analysis has several applications, including forensic, security, medical, and disease prediction. This paper presents the most recent handwriting analysis techniques and advancements available in the literature for age and gender classification/detection. Different steps, including feature extraction and classification, frequently used in the literature for age and gender detection, are discussed, and the presented works are classified according to the applied feature extraction and classification methods. The online and offline benchmark databases are also reviewed. We used a text mining technique to perform a quantitative content analysis of the presented research and better understand the co-occurrence network diagrams of age and gender classification/detection. This study is a valuable resource that provides new research directions to students and researchers interested in this field for further research and investigation."

                "Solving puzzle problems using <em>computer</em>-aided methods is becoming more common with applications in forensic <em>science</em>, restoration, banking system, and multimedia. However, only a few surveys have been published on this topic, the most recent being more than a decade old. The scope of 2D puzzle problems is extensive, and the number of <em>computer</em>-aided methods has increased in recent years. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive survey to pave a roadmap for researchers dealing with puzzle problems. This study classifies 2D puzzle problems in a novel way, considering many examples such as dissection, combinatorial and double-sided puzzles and reclassifies <em>computer</em>-aided methods to cover the studies carried out in recent years. Various strategies (pre-grouping and global consistency approach) have been investigated to solve the puzzle problem effectively. The <em>computer</em>-aided methods have been examined deeply, including many recent methods related to squared jigsaw puzzles, torn photographs, banknotes, and fragmented documents, and they are compared to each other. In addition, new topics such as combining mosaic pieces and Islamic architectural motif puzzle problems have been proposed to the interest of researchers. In conclusion, our study shows many research opportunities that are not yet solved by any <em>computer</em>-aided method."

                "Designing functional molecules is the prerogative of experts who have advanced knowledge and experience in their fields. To democratize automatic molecular design for both experts and nonexperts, we introduce a generic open-sourced framework, ChemTSv2, to design molecules based on a de novo molecule generator equipped with an easy-to-use interface. Besides, ChemTSv2 can easily be integrated with various simulation packages, such as Gaussian 16 package, and supports a massively parallel exploration that accelerates molecular designs. We exhibit the potential of molecular design with ChemTSv2, including previous work, such as chromophores, fluorophores, drugs, and so forth. ChemTSv2 contributes to democratizing inverse molecule design in various disciplines relevant to chemistry.

                "Over the last decade, deep learning (DL) has contributed to a paradigm shift in <em>computer</em> vision and image recognition creating widespread opportunities of using artificial intelligence in research as well as industrial applications. DL has been extensively studied in medical imaging applications, including those related to pulmonary diseases. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer, pneumonia, and, more recently, COVID-19 are common lung diseases affecting nearly 7.4% of world population. Pulmonary imaging has been widely investigated toward improving our understanding of disease etiologies and early diagnosis and assessment of disease progression and clinical outcomes. DL has been broadly applied to solve various pulmonary image processing challenges including classification, recognition, registration, and segmentation. This article presents a survey of pulmonary diseases, roles of imaging in translational and clinical pulmonary research, and applications of different DL architectures and methods in pulmonary imaging with emphasis on DL-based segmentation of major pulmonary anatomies such as lung volumes, lung lobes, pulmonary vessels, and airways as well as thoracic musculoskeletal anatomies related to pulmonary diseases.

                "Over the last few decades, <em>computer</em> programming has become an important field of endeavor due to rapid development in the information sector. Despite the importance of programming, there is a growing concern that it is relatively difficult. In the process, researchers have started employing media tools to reduce programming difficulties and motivate learners to approach programming problems. One of the common tools widely used is program animation—an instructional medium that incorporates animated characters. However, little is known about the research trends in this field of study. This article, therefore, employed a systematic mapping method to review this trend to find patterns and gaps left in the literature. The study extracted 48 articles published between 2000 and 2022 from four scientific databases (Web of <em>Science</em>, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and ERIC) and three digital libraries (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and Wiley Online Library). The review discovered important trends. First, there is a paucity of research evidence evaluating program animation in the context of secondary and elementary levels; the majority of the extracted studies focused on participants from tertiary institutions. A similar paucity of research evidence employing mixed methods and qualitative approaches was also noted. Scratch programs were used in recent research more often than other program animations. There is also too little evaluation of psychomotor variables. Finally, there exist inconsistent findings on the effect of program animation although plenty of studies revealed positive results in favor of these media tools. The study therefore recommends that future research should be conducted to fill these identified gaps."

                "Cancer of the lung is a killer illness that often results from a combination of genetic disposition and many clinical changes. The lung region of the body contains cancerous cells that develop atypically and threaten human life. To determine what might be helpful for its treatment, Lung cancer, also known as a Lung tumour, must be promptly and accurately discovered in its early stages. One of the most common malignancies and the main reason for cancer-related deaths globally is lung cancer. Its early detection offers a great chance to save lives. Therefore, automated lung cancer detection and classification from radiological data aided with machine learning and deep learning techniques have become essential because it provides a precise, trustworthy, and rapid investigation of the condition’s progression. This study summarises the current state of the art for automated lung cancer identification using machine learning from lung images, as stated in several recent publications. A thorough and extensive review was conducted after reading numerous research papers of latest 10 years from the compilation of this article, book chapters and articles Published inreputable national and worldwide databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, SpringerLink, <em>Science</em> Direct, Scopus and Google scholar. Several conference proceedings have also been included, provided they meet our quality review standards. The majority of the current algorithms enable an accuracy of almost 95% on openly available LIDC-IDRI , Lung Cancer data ‘ data.world ’ datasets. According to reports, deep Neural Networks, K-Nearest-Neighbors and Support Vector Machines are highly effective algorithms for classifying lung cancer from radiological images such as CT, MRI, and X-ray. For researchers and scholars in this discipline, this study not only highlighted obstacles but also highlighted and presented fresh research prospects. It has been generally recognised that while deep learning has mostly taken over the discipline of analysing medical images, classic machine learning methods like SVM and GMM performed excellently in classification. According to the articles that have been evaluated, the methodologies that are now in use still may need some improvements, which causes them to classify lung tumours with less accuracy. Furthermore, most algorithms today operate on a single type of radiological pictures like CT or MRI. This accuracy may be improved by changing several factors, like the features that need to be retrieved, improving noise removal, and employing hybrid segmentation and classification approaches like multi-level classifiers. Performance can be enhanced by combining the K-nearest-neighbours approach with other algorithms like support vector machines, pixel-level classifications, and extraction of regions of interest. This article will benefit the researchers working in this field to gain insight into how machine learning and deep learning techniques perform best when used with certain types of data collection, choice of features, numerous problems, and their suggested solutions in order to solve this challenging problem. At the conclusion of this review paper, limitations and potential areas for future study in the field of applying various machine learning approaches to the classification and diagnosis of lung cancer are also discussed."

                "Artificial intelligence covers a variety of methods and disciplines including vision, perception, speech and dialogue, decision making and planning, problem solving, robotics and other applications in which self-learning is possible. The aim of this work was to study the possibilities of using AI algorithms at various stages of construction to ensure the safety of the process. The objects of this research were scientific publications about the use of artificial intelligence in construction and ways to optimize this process. To search for information, Scopus and Web of <em>Science</em> databases were used for the period from the early 1990s (the appearance of the first publication on the topic) until the end of 2022. Generalization was the main method. It has been established that artificial intelligence is a set of technologies and methods used to complement traditional human qualities, such as intelligence as well as analytical and other abilities. The use of 3D modeling for the design of buildings, machine learning for the conceptualization of design in 3D, <em>computer</em> vision, planning for the effective use of construction equipment, artificial intelligence and artificial superintelligence have been studied. It is proven that automatic programming for natural language processing, knowledge-based systems, robots, building maintenance, adaptive strategies, adaptive programming, genetic algorithms and the use of unmanned aircraft systems allow an evaluation of the use of artificial intelligence in construction. The prospects of using AI in construction are shown."

                "This paper presents a systematic review of articles on <em>computer</em>-vision-based flying obstacle detection with a focus on midair collision avoidance. Publications from the beginning until 2022 were searched in Scopus, IEEE, ACM, MDPI, and Web of <em>Science</em> databases. From the initial 647 publications obtained, 85 were finally selected and examined. The results show an increasing interest in this topic, especially in relation to object detection and tracking. Our study hypothesizes that the widespread access to commercial drones, the improvements in single-board <em>computers</em>, and their compatibility with <em>computer</em> vision libraries have contributed to the increase in the number of publications. The review also shows that the proposed algorithms are mainly tested using simulation software and flight simulators, and only 26 papers report testing with physical flying vehicles. This systematic review highlights other gaps to be addressed in future work. Several identified challenges are related to increasing the success rate of threat detection and testing solutions in complex scenarios."

                "Computational literacy (CL) has become indispensable for teachers and learners as part of 21st-century skills. Therefore, corresponding models for teacher education are being further developed internationally from a scientific perspective. In parallel, content and competencies are being enhanced in the respective subjects at the curricular level of teacher training. In this context, we consider it important to examine the current status of this development. Since, to our knowledge, there are no comparable scientific studies, we have taken Germany as a representative example of the international education system and systematically analyzed the module handbooks of the physics teacher training courses at methodically selected universities. For this analysis, we used three research questions focusing on CL: In which physics content does CL play a role? Which <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> competencies or knowledge can be identified or derived? Are they described implicitly or explicitly? Our results suggest that CL is integrated very differently in terms of quantity and depth of content among the universities we examined. For example, there is often a very strong focus on <em>computer</em>-based data acquisition, but few programs also have specialized courses addressing CL more explicitly or integrate additional <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> competencies. CL is primarily taught in laboratory courses and frequently in subject-didactic courses. Nevertheless, the depictions presented in the purely subject-oriented and basic lectures lack specific computational literacy skills or knowledge. Furthermore, the fact that many programs only offer implicit descriptions of CL skills indicates that the integration of these skills has not progressed very far in practice."

                "In An era where technology advances at an unprecedented pace, the healthcare sector stands at the cusp of a transformative revolution. The confluence of distributed Big Data intelligence with instantaneous e-healthcare services heralds a new paradigm, where the boundaries between medicine, artificial intelligence, and data <em>science</em> are blurred, giving rise to innovative solutions that redefine patient care. The emergence of personalized medicine, bolstered by the power of machine learning, graph-based techniques, and real-time analysis, is not merely a technological triumph but a testament to human ingenuity. It's a response to a world grappling with complex diseases, burgeoning healthcare costs, and an ever-increasing demand for precision and efficiency."

                "(1) Introduction: This review aimed to synthesize the significant literature addressing digital techniques for producing removable partial denture (RPD) metal frameworks, focusing on oral fit outcomes. (2) Material and Methods: A systematic review of the Web of <em>Science</em> and Pubmed databases was performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. The selection was for original articles in English containing relevant data on RPD metal frameworks produced with digital techniques, including study characteristics, digital techniques, and fit assessment methods and outcomes. (3) Results: From the 967 search studies, 405 were duplications, and 521 were excluded after screening against set criteria. A manual search included 21 studies resulting in 62 papers for review. Extra-oral was more frequently used than intra-oral scanning. The <em>computer</em>-assisted design was the most applied digital technique. Additive manufacturing was preferred to milling for direct and indirect fabrication of frameworks. Fit assessments were based on qualitative measures, but quantitative evaluation showed acceptable clinical fit for RPDs made by digital protocols. (4) Conclusions: The combination of direct metal additive manufacturing with conventional impression was the most used protocol and included better qualitative and quantitative fit outcomes than the other digital protocols."

                "The “Internet-of-Medical-Vehicles (IOMV)” is one of the special applications of the Internet of Things resulting from combining connected healthcare and connected vehicles. As the IOMV communicates with a variety of networks along its travel path, it incurs various security risks due to sophisticated cyber-attacks. This can endanger the onboard patient’s life. So, it is critical to understand subjects related to “cybersecurity” in the IOMV to develop robust cybersecurity measures. In this paper, the goal is to evaluate recent trends and state-of-the-art publications, gaps, and future outlooks related to this research area. With this aim, a variety of publications between 2016 and 2023 from “Web-of-<em>Science</em>” and “Scopus” databases were analysed. Our analysis revealed that the IOMV is a niche and unexplored research area with few defined standards and frameworks, and there is a great need to implement robust cybersecurity measures. This paper will help researchers to gain a comprehensive idea of this niche research topic, as it presents an analysis of top journals and highly cited papers, their challenges and limitations, the system model and architecture of the IOMV, related applicable standards, potential cyber-attacks, factors causing cybersecurity risks, various artificial intelligence techniques for developing potential countermeasures, the assessment and parameterisation of cybersecurity risks, constraints and challenges, and future outlooks for implementing cybersecurity measures in the IOMV."

                "Background: The use of Electronic Health Records is the most important milestone in the digitization and intelligence of the entire medical industry. AI can effectively mine the immense medical information contained in EHRs, potentially assist doctors in reducing many medical errors. Objective: This article aims to summarize the research status and trends in using AI to mine medical information from EHRs for the past thirteen years and investigate its information application. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in 5 databases, including Web of <em>Science</em> Core Collection and PubMed, to identify research using AI to mine medical information from EHRs for the past thirteen years. Furthermore, bibliometric and content analysis were used to explore the research hotspots and trends, and systematically analyze the conversion rate of research resources in this field. Results: A total of 631 articles were included and analyzed. The number of published articles has increased rapidly after 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 55.73%. The US (41.68%) and China (19.65%) publish the most articles, but there is a lack of international cooperation. The extraction of disease lesions is a hot topic at present, and the research topic is gradually shifting from disease risk grading to disease risk prediction. Classification (66%), and regress (15%) are the main implemented AI tasks. For AI algorithms, deep learning (31.70%), decision tree algorithms family (26.47%), and regression algorithms family (17.43%) are used most frequently. The funding rate for publications is 69.26%, and the input–output conversion rate is 21.05%. Conclusions: Over the past decade, the use of AI to mine medical information from EHRs has been developing rapidly. However, it is necessary to strengthen international cooperation, improve EHRs data availability, focus on interpretable AI algorithms, and improve the resource conversion rate in future research."

                "Background: The substantial growth in gamification research has connected gamified learning to enhanced engagement, improved performance, and greater motivation. Similar to gamification, personalized learning analytics dashboards can enhance student engagement. Objectives: This study explores the student experiences and academic achievements using a gamified dashboard in a large, introductory STEM course. Methods: We examined two groups of students enrolled in different sections of a one-semester-long physical geology course with a total enrollment of 223 students. The only difference between the groups was that one had access to the dashboard. The data collection included students' assignments, overall performances, and exam scores. Students in both sections completed a <em>Science</em> Literacy Concept Inventory survey at the beginning and end of the term. Additionally, students completed an end-of-term survey containing open-ended questions on their experience and interactions with specific elements. Results: Students shared mostly positive comments about their experience with the dashboard, and the final grade of students with access to the dashboard was 13% higher, on average, compared to their peers in the non-dashboard section. Conclusion: With low costs and little time invested, gamified dashboards could have a significant impact on student performance in large STEM lecture courses."

                "Human activity recognition (HAR) using inertial motion data has gained a lot of momentum in recent years both in research and industrial applications. From the abstract perspective, this has been driven by the rapid dynamics for building intelligent, smart environments, and ubiquitous systems that cover all aspects of human life including healthcare, sports, manufacturing, commerce, etc., which necessitate and subsume activity recognition aiming at recognizing the actions, characteristics, and goals of one or more agent(s) from a temporal series of observations streamed from one or more sensors. From a more concrete and seemingly orthogonal perspective, such momentum has been driven by the ubiquity of inertial motion sensors on-board mobile and wearable devices including smartphones, smartwatches, etc. In this paper we give an introductory and a comprehensive survey to the subject from a given perspective. We focus on a subset of topics, that we think are major, that will have significant and influential impacts on the future research and industrial-scale deployment of HAR systems. These include: (1) a comprehensive and detailed description of the inertial motion benchmark datasets that are publicly available and/or accessible, (2) feature selection and extraction techniques and the corresponding learning methods used to build workable HAR systems; we survey classical handcrafted datasets as well as data-oriented automatic representation learning approach to the subject, (3) transfer learning as a way to overcome many hurdles in actual deployments of HAR systems on a large scale, (4) embedded implementations of HAR systems on mobile and/or wearable devices, and finally (5) we touch on adversarial attacks, a topic that is essentially related to the security and privacy of HAR systems. As the field is very huge and diverse, this article is by no means comprehensive; it is though meant to provide a logically and conceptually rather complete picture to advanced practitioners, as well as to present a readable guided introduction to newcomers. Our logical and conceptual perspectives mimic the typical data <em>science</em> pipeline for state-of-the-art AI-based systems."

                "In today's connected society, many people rely on mHealth and self-tracking (ST) technology to help them adopt healthier habits with a focus on breaking their sedentary lifestyle and staying fit. However, there is scarce evidence of such technological interventions' effectiveness, and there are no standardized methods to evaluate their impact on people's physical activity and health. This work aims to help ST practitioners and researchers by empowering them with systematic guidelines and a framework for designing and evaluating technological interventions to facilitate health behavior change and user engagement, focusing on increasing physical activity and decreasing sedentariness. To this end, we conduct a literature review of 129 papers between 2008 and 2022, which identifies the core ST design principles and their efficacy, as well as the most comprehensive list to date of user engagement evaluation metrics for ST. Based on the review's findings, we propose PAST SELF, a framework to guide the design and evaluation of ST technology that has potential applications in industrial and scientific settings. Finally, to facilitate researchers and practitioners, we complement this article with an open corpus and an online, adaptive exploration tool for the PAST SELF data."

                "Agile was initially created for software project management. Its use, however, has extended to fields such as education since it encourages active student learning (Krehbiel et al., 2017). Thus, Agile can facilitate student agency by intervening in learning responsibility. This scoping review under PRISMA, PRISMA-ScR and PRISMA-S protocols aims to identify whether Agile teaching strategies contribute to student agency in higher education, and whether these strategies are deployed with support from technology resources. The findings from 116 selected documents indicate a growing interest in these strategies. Scrum is the most widely used Agile framework, mainly in <em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>. Additionally, we have identified several technology resources for communication, collaboration and management in Agile projects. With regard to agency, concurrent factors such as self-regulated learning, ownership of learning, autonomy or collaboration are noted (Marín et al., 2020). Future work would involve a qualitative analysis to develop a model with Agile-based instructional design principles to support agency."

                "Mobile learning (M-Learning) has become a popular and effective method of education that leverages the ubiquity of mobile devices. M-Learning has digitally transformed the process of teaching and learning. It has tremendous potential to empower all sections of society through education and training. This study presents a systematic literature review of M-Learning. The articles were retrieved from Scopus and Web of <em>Science</em> databases. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, a final selection of 161 articles published between 2016 and 2022 was included in the review. To analyze the articles, the researchers employed the TCCM (Theory, Context, Characteristics, Methods) framework, which facilitated addressing the research questions. This review identified various theories, such as behaviorism, constructivism, cognitivism, situated learning, problem-based learning, context awareness learning, socio-cultural theory, collaborative learning, conversational learning, lifelong learning, informal learning, activity theory, connectivism, navigation, and location-based learning, that are used to support and guide the implementation of M-Learning. In terms of context, developing countries contributed to 70.8% of the studies, while developed countries contributed to 29.1%. Further, a majority of the studies, 93%, involved students followed by faculty members and only two studies involved staff from higher education management. A total of 19 unique characteristic factors have been identified, such as personal, intention, attitude, usage, utility, ease of use, learnability, social, technological, pedagogical, anxiety, enjoyment, accessibility, knowledge, experience, trust, price, and habit. A quantitative research design was used in 90% of the studies, followed by mixed methods research design in 7% of the studies, and qualitative research design in only 3% of the studies. Further, this article synthesizes previous research findings and highlights gaps for future research. Overall, this review contributes to the understanding and advancement of M-Learning as a valuable educational platform."

                "The rapid advancement of information technology (IT) has given rise to a new era of efficient and fast communication and transactions. However, the increasing adoption of and reliance on IT has led to the exposure of personal and sensitive information online. Safeguarding this information against unauthorized access remains a persistent challenge, necessitating the implementation of improved <em>computer</em> security measures. The core objective of <em>computer</em> security is to ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data and services. Among the mechanisms developed to counter security threats, authentication stands out as a pivotal defense strategy. Graphical passwords have emerged as a popular authentication approach, yet they face vulnerability to shoulder-surfing attacks, wherein an attacker can clandestinely observe a victim’s actions. Shoulder-surfing attacks present a significant security challenge within the realm of graphical password authentication. These attacks occur when an unauthorized individual covertly observes the authentication process of a legitimate user by shoulder surfing the user or capturing the interaction through a video recording. In response to this challenge, various methods have been proposed to thwart shoulder-surfing attacks, each with distinct advantages and limitations. This study thus centers on reviewing the resilience of existing recognition-based graphical password techniques against shoulder-surfing attacks by conducting a comprehensive examination and evaluation of their benefits, strengths, and weaknesses. The evaluation process entailed accessing pertinent academic resources through renowned search engines, including Web of <em>Science</em>, <em>Science</em> Direct, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, Scopus, Springer, Wiley Online Library, and EBSCO. The selection criteria were carefully designed to prioritize studies that focused on recognition-based graphical password methods. Through this rigorous approach, 28 studies were identified and subjected to a thorough review. The results show that fourteen of them adopted registered objects as pass-objects, bolstering security through object recognition. Additionally, two methods employed decoy objects as pass-objects, enhancing obfuscation. Notably, one technique harnessed both registered and decoy objects, amplifying the security paradigm. The results also showed that recognition-based graphical password techniques varied in their resistance to different types of shoulder-surfing attacks. Some methods were effective in preventing direct observation attacks, while others were vulnerable to video-recorded and multiple-observation attacks. This vulnerability emerged due to attackers potentially extracting key information by analyzing user interaction patterns in each challenge set. Notably, one method stood out as an exception, demonstrating resilience against all three types of shoulder-surfing attacks. In conclusion, this study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of recognition-based graphical password methods in countering shoulder-surfing attacks by analyzing the diverse strategies employed by these methods and revealing their strengths and weaknesses."

                "Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes <em>computer</em> systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. Examples of AI techniques are machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. AI can be applied in many different areas, such as econometrics, biometry, e-commerce, and the automotive industry. In recent years, AI has found its way into healthcare as well, helping doctors make better decisions (“clinical decision support”), localizing tumors in magnetic resonance images, reading and analyzing reports written by radiologists and pathologists, and much more. However, AI has one big risk: it can be perceived as a “black box”, limiting trust in its reliability, which is a very big issue in an area in which a decision can mean life or death. As a result, the term Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been gaining momentum. XAI tries to ensure that AI algorithms (and the resulting decisions) can be understood by humans. In this narrative review, we will have a look at some central concepts in XAI, describe several challenges around XAI in healthcare, and discuss whether it can really help healthcare to advance, for example, by increasing understanding and trust. Finally, alternatives to increase trust in AI are discussed, as well as future research possibilities in the area of XAI."

                "The capabilities of autonomous mobile robotic systems have been steadily improving due to recent advancements in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, engineering, and related disciplines such as cognitive <em>science</em>. In controlled environments, robots have achieved relatively high levels of autonomy. In more unstructured environments, however, the development of fully autonomous mobile robots remains challenging due to the complexity of understanding these environments. Many autonomous mobile robots use classical, learning-based or hybrid approaches for navigation. More recent learning-based methods may replace the complete navigation pipeline or selected stages of the classical approach. For effective deployment, autonomous robots must understand their external environments at a sophisticated level according to their intended applications. Therefore, in addition to robot perception, scene analysis and higher-level scene understanding (e.g., traversable/non-traversable, rough or smooth terrain, etc.) are required for autonomous robot navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. This paper provides a comprehensive review and critical analysis of these methods in the context of their applications to the problems of robot perception and scene understanding in unstructured environments and the related problems of localisation, environment mapping and path planning. State-of-the-art sensor fusion methods and multimodal scene understanding approaches are also discussed and evaluated within this context. The paper concludes with an in-depth discussion regarding the current state of the autonomous ground robot navigation challenge in unstructured outdoor environments and the most promising future research directions to overcome these challenges."

                "Forensics is an established field of research. Digital forensics started 44 years ago with the Florida <em>Computer</em> Crimes Act (1978) including legislation against the unauthorized modification of data on a <em>computer</em> system. Since then, the field has flourished in different subdomains. The overall definitions and concepts have been specified by a small group of experts. Furthermore, the need for development is created by the amount of digital evidence which is collected concerning most crimes. This paper gives an overview of the state-of-the-art by presenting a structured literature review of digital forensic about methods and concepts using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. The review focuses on <em>science</em> done on topics in strong AI and forensics."

                "Digital images are playing a progressively important role in almost all the fields such as <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, medicine, communications, transmission, security, surveillance, and many more. Digital images are susceptible to a number of distortions due to faulty imaging instruments, transmission channels, atmospheric and environmental conditions, etc. resulting in degraded images. Degradation can be of different types such as noise, backscattering, low saturation, low contrast, tilt, spectral absorption, blurring, etc. The degradation reduces digital images' effectiveness and therefore needs to be restored. In this paper, we present an extensive review of image restoration tasks. It addresses problems like image deblurring, denoising, dehazing and super-resolution. Image restoration is fundamentally an image processing problem, but deep learning techniques, based mainly on convolutional neural networks have received a lot of attention in almost all areas of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. Along with deep learning, other machine learning methods have also been tried for restoring digital images. In this review, we have therefore categorized digital image restoration techniques as either image processing-based, machine learning-based or deep learning-based. For each category, a variety of approaches presented in recent years have been reviewed. This review also includes a summary of the data sets used for image restoration along with a baseline reference that can be used by future researchers to compare and improve their results. We also suggest some interesting research directions for future work in this area."

                "Automated demarcation of stoke lesions from monospectral magnetic resonance imaging scans is extremely useful for diverse research and clinical applications, including lesion-symptom mapping to explain deficits and predict recovery. There is a significant surge of interest in the development of supervised artificial intelligence (AI) methods for that purpose, including deep learning, with a performance comparable to trained experts. Such AI-based methods, however, require copious amounts of data. Thanks to the availability of large datasets, the development of AI-based methods for lesion segmentation has immensely accelerated in the last decade. One of these datasets is the Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) dataset which includes T1-weighted images from hundreds of chronic stroke survivors with their manually traced lesions. This systematic review offers an appraisal of the impact of the ATLAS dataset in promoting the development of AI-based segmentation of stroke lesions. An examination of all published studies, that used the ATLAS dataset to both train and test their methods, highlighted an overall moderate performance (median Dice index = 59.40%) and a huge variability across studies in terms of data preprocessing, data augmentation, AI architecture, and the mode of operation (two-dimensional versus three-dimensional methods). Perhaps most importantly, almost all AI tools were borrowed from existing AI architectures in <em>computer</em> vision, as 90% of all selected studies relied on conventional convolutional neural network-based architectures. Overall, current research has not led to the development of robust AI architectures than can handle spatially heterogenous lesion patterns. This review also highlights the difficulty of gauging the performance of AI tools in the presence of uncertainties in the definition of the ground truth."

                "The Internet has become an important environment in everyday life of children and youth. Consequently, understanding basic Internet concepts has been listed as a target competence in many school curricula. However, any constructive approach to teaching concepts of the Internet should take into account learners’ initial conceptions, shaped by daily experiences, that they bring into the classroom. Based on a systematic literature review of research published between January 2000 and March 2022, we synthesized more than 400 descriptions reported by children and youth and classified them into five categories: (1) the structure of the Internet, (2) responsibility for the operation of the Internet, (3) web search engines and their function, (4) transmission techniques and (5) services of the Internet, as well as into subcategories that encompass commonly found kinds of conceptions within these categories. In addition, we classified all conceptions into three types: (1) intuitive, (2) elaborate and (3) misconception. The results show that children and youth hold more intuitive than elaborate conceptions. They also hold many misconceptions in all five categories. Although it has been suggested that age or user's online experiences may be important factors for shaping elaborate conceptions about the Internet, we observed that many intuitive conceptions and misconceptions seem to be persistent across different age groups. This indicates that these factors, although necessary, but may not be sufficient for developing adequate conceptions. Instead, we argue that an elaborate conception of the structure of the Internet requires explicit learning and instruction. Finally, we explain implications of our findings for education and for future research."

                "Forecasting sea level is critical for coastal structure building and port operations. There are, however, challenges in making these predictions, resulting from the complicated processes at various periods. This study discussed the continual development of the application and forecasting approaches for sea level rise, in standard and advanced modeling versions. To date, the tide gauge and satellite altimetry are the commonly used approaches for sea level measurement. Tide gauges are mostly deficient in typical offshore circumstances; but however, this may be compensated for with satellite altimetry, a complementing technique. With technological improvement, sea level measurement may be forecasted using a variety of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> approaches known as artificial intelligence, including machine learning and deep learning; capable of extracting information and formulating relationships from the given dataset. Its potential and extensive advantages led to a sharp growth in its recognition among hydrologists. The most successful techniques for enhancing these approaches include hybridization, ensemble modeling, data decomposition, and algorithm optimization. These advanced techniques are a prominent study area and a viable strategy for determining intelligent forecasts of sea level rise with sufficient lead time. For improved performance, the modeling requires incorporating numerous input parameters, such as precipitation, wind direction, ocean current, and sea surface temperature; for better representing the process, thus reducing forecast error and uncertainty. Deep learning is more effective and enhances existing machine learning models for forecasting future sea level rise due to its automatic feature extraction and memory-storing capability."

                "Nanofluidics research has achieved a significant growth over the past few years. New phenomena of nanoscaled fluid flows are being reported continuously, such as altered liquid properties, fast flows, and ion rectification, which attract tremendous research interests in many fields, such as membrane <em>science</em>, biological nanochips, and energy conventions. Multiscale simulations, covering quantum mechanics, molecular mechanics, coarse-grained particle dynamics (mesoscale), and continuum mechanics, have shown their great advantages in studying the new frontier of nanofluidics in academia and industry, which is in range of 1–1000 nm scale. These simulations provide the opportunity to visualize the nanofluidics applications existed in the minds of scientists and then guide experimental design to realize the potential of nanofluidics applications in industrial. In this article, we attempt to give a comprehensive review of nanofluidics from the aspect of multiscale simulations. The methodology and role of various simulation methods used in the investigation of nanofluidics are presented. The properties and characteristics of nanofluidics are summarized. The applications of nanofluidics in recent years are emphasized. And then the development of simulation methods and the application of nanofluidics are also prospected. This article is categorized under: Molecular and Statistical Mechanics > Molecular Dynamics and Monte-Carlo Methods Software > Simulation Methods."

                "With the rise of the digital economy, new business models have expedited the progress of corporate digital transformation. The mobile internet era has made enterprise social media a popular tool for employee communication. Summarizing the development and trends of enterprise social media research is beneficial for identifying future research topics. This paper analyzes the literature from the Web of <em>Science</em> core collection database and employs CiteSpace software to develop a scientific knowledge map, providing a visual analysis of the literature on enterprise social media in the context of the digital economy. The paper presents the research hotspots and evolutionary paths of enterprise social media, thereby clarifying the future development trends in this field. The study reveals that there is a relatively limited amount of literature on this topic, and collaboration among authors is not strong. Most research is conducted by higher education institutions in China and the United States. The research hotspots revolve around the theme of enterprise social media, covering topics such as knowledge sharing, communication, and performance. The research themes have undergone a transition from singularity to diversity. Finally, this paper proposes future research prospects in three areas: the human–<em>computer</em> collaborative model against the backdrop of artificial intelligence, user privacy disclosure and protection, and the impact of enterprise social media usage on the mental and physical health of employees. These prospects aim to provide valuable insights for subsequent research endeavors."

                "The educational landscape is an environment prone to change due to the volatile and ever-changing nature of the digital society in which we all live. Although the world moves at different speeds and any generalization is bound to have some exceptions, there is evidence from research conducted in different places and contexts that educational methods are becoming increasingly digitized and driven by technological innovation. Among the technological trends fueled in many cases by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to stay at home but online, augmented reality solutions received an additional boost as a valid and versatile educational technology worth exploring and eventually integrating into several teaching methods already in use. Although the technology still faces problems related to affordability, accessibility, and the technical skills required of users, some ongoing projects have already provided evidence that using augmented reality solutions as teaching and learning tools can improve teacher and student learning outcomes by increasing engagement and interactivity. The same issues arose when personal <em>computers</em>, tablets, and smartphones were first discussed as valuable tools for education and have now found their way into most classrooms. This paper reviews some of the key concepts related to augmented reality, as well as some current trends, benefits, and concerns related to its integration into educational contexts in areas such as life <em>sciences</em>, engineering, and health. The work conducted and presented in this paper provides an interesting insight into a technology that has given rise to global phenomena such as Pokémon Go, and continues to improve in terms of portability, usability, and overall user experience. Throughout the paper and in the conclusion section, we discuss the relevance of using the best features of augmented reality and how they can contribute to positive educational outcomes."

                "The rapid development of the Intelligent connected vehicle (ICV) industry has stimulated technological innovation in energy and communication while also highlighting the need for effective policies and road safety measures. Understanding and addressing road safety issues in the context of ICVs can contribute to ICV development and safe driving. This paper employs a knowledge mapping approach to scientifically and intuitively demonstrate research on the road safety issues of ICV over the last decade. By utilizing bibliometric tools such as CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and SciMAT, a total of 3661 original articles from the Web of <em>Science</em> are examined to explore three aspects. Firstly, the study investigates the collaborative relationships among authors and institutions within the industry. Secondly, it summarizes major research topics by analyzing and clustering keywords. Lastly, the paper identifies research hotspots and predicts future research directions. The findings reveal a dynamic field characterized by close collaboration among diverse institutions, with China and the United States emerging as the most active countries and mathematics and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> journals becoming mainstream. According to three bibliometric tools, the research topics primarily revolve around three areas: Vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANET), intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and network security. Machine learning and V2X communication are predicted to be essential research topics in the next stage. Research on traffic accidents still has potential as the number of ICVs increases."

                "Many financial technology (fintech) applications have incorporated interactive <em>computer</em> agents to act as mediators between the user and the fintech system. This paper provides a comprehensive review of interactive fintech agents from technological and social <em>science</em> perspectives. First, we explain the general fintech landscape and define interactive fintech agents. Next, we review the major technologies involved in creating fintech: (1) artificial intelligence and machine learning, (2) big data, (3) cloud computing, and (4) blockchain; as well as the specific key technologies enabling the following aspects of interactive fintech agents: (1) intelligence, (2) understanding of users, and (3) manifestation as social actors. Following the technology review, we examine issues and theories related to human-fintech agent interaction in the following areas: (1) agents’ understanding of users, (2) agents’ manifestation as social actors (via embodiment, emotion, and personality), and (3) users’ social interaction with agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research on fintech agents."

                "Drug discovery and development affects various aspects of human health and dramatically impacts the pharmaceutical market. However, investments in a new drug often go unrewarded due to the long and complex process of drug research and development (R&D). With the advancement of experimental technology and <em>computer</em> hardware, artificial intelligence (AI) has recently emerged as a leading tool in analyzing abundant and high-dimensional data. Explosive growth in the size of biomedical data provides advantages in applying AI in all stages of drug R&D. Driven by big data in biomedicine, AI has led to a revolution in drug R&D, due to its ability to discover new drugs more efficiently and at lower cost. This review begins with a brief overview of common AI models in the field of drug discovery; then, it summarizes and discusses in depth their specific applications in various stages of drug R&D, such as target discovery, drug discovery and design, preclinical research, automated drug synthesis, and influences in the pharmaceutical market. Finally, the major limitations of AI in drug R&D are fully discussed and possible solutions are proposed."

                "Objective: The proper handling of missing values is critical to delivering reliable estimates and decisions, especially in high-stakes fields such as clinical research. In response to the increasing diversity and complexity of data, many researchers have developed deep learning (DL)-based imputation techniques. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the use of these techniques, with a particular focus on the types of data, intending to assist healthcare researchers from various disciplines in dealing with missing data. Materials and methods: We searched five databases (MEDLINE, Web of <em>Science</em>, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus) for articles published prior to February 8, 2023 that described the use of DL-based models for imputation. We examined selected articles from four perspectives: data types, model backbones (i.e., main architectures), imputation strategies, and comparisons with non-DL-based methods. Based on data types, we created an evidence map to illustrate the adoption of DL models. Results: Out of 1822 articles, a total of 111 were included, of which tabular static data (29 %, 32/111) and temporal data (40 %, 44/111) were the most frequently investigated. Our findings revealed a discernible pattern in the choice of model backbones and data types, for example, the dominance of autoencoder and recurrent neural networks for tabular temporal data. The discrepancy in imputation strategy usage among data types was also observed. The “integrated” imputation strategy, which solves the imputation task simultaneously with downstream tasks, was most popular for tabular temporal data (52 %, 23/44) and multi-modal data (56 %, 5/9). Moreover, DL-based imputation methods yielded a higher level of imputation accuracy than non-DL methods in most studies. Conclusion: The DL-based imputation models are a family of techniques, with diverse network structures. Their designation in healthcare is usually tailored to data types with different characteristics. Although DL-based imputation models may not be superior to conventional approaches across all datasets, it is highly possible for them to achieve satisfactory results for a particular data type or dataset. There are, however, still issues with regard to portability, interpretability, and fairness associated with current DL-based imputation models."

                "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has clustered patients based on clinical features into sub-clusters to stratify high-risk and low-risk groups to predict outcomes in lung cancer after radiotherapy and has gained much more attention in recent years. Given that the conclusions vary considerably, this meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the combined predictive effect of AI models on lung cancer. Methods: This study was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, ISI Web of <em>Science</em>, and Embase databases were searched for relevant literature. Outcomes, including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and local control (LC), were predicted using AI models in patients with lung cancer after radiotherapy, and were used to calculate the pooled effect. Quality, heterogeneity, and publication bias of the included studies were also evaluated. Results: Eighteen articles with 4719 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. The combined hazard ratios (HRs) of the included studies for OS, LC, PFS, and DFS of lung cancer patients were 2.55 (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.73–3.76), 2.45 (95 % CI = 0.78–7.64), 3.84 (95 % CI = 2.20–6.68), and 2.66 (95 % CI = 0.96–7.34), respectively. The combined area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of the included articles on OS and LC in patients with lung cancer was 0.75 (95 % CI = 0.67–0.84), and 0.80 (95%CI = 0.0.68–0.95), respectively. Conclusion: The clinical feasibility of predicting outcomes using AI models after radiotherapy in patients with lung cancer was demonstrated. Large-scale, prospective, multicenter studies should be conducted to more accurately predict the outcomes in patients with lung cancer."

                "Artificial intelligence and mechanical engineering are two mature fields of <em>science</em> that intersect more and more often. <em>Computer</em>-aided mechanical analysis tools, including multibody dynamics software, are very versatile and have revolutionalized many industries. However, as shown by the literature presented in this review, combining the advantages of multibody system dynamics and machine learning creates new and exciting possibilities. For example, the multibody method can assist machine learning by providing synthetic data, while machine learning can provide fast and accurate subsystem models. The intersection of both approaches results in surrogate and hybrid modeling techniques, advanced control algorithms, and optimal design applications. A notable example is the development of autonomous systems for vehicles, robots, and mobile machinery. In our review we have found nontrivial, innovative, and even surprising applications of machine learning and multibody dynamics. This review focuses on applying neural networks, mainly deep learning, in connection with the multibody system method. Over one hundred and fifty papers are covered, and three main research areas are identified and introduced: data-driven modeling, model-based control and estimation, and data-driven control. The paper starts with a primer on machine learning and concludes with future research directions. The main goal is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of existing literature to inspire further research."

                "In the fields of engineering and data <em>sciences</em>, the optimization problems arise on regular basis. With the progress in the field of scientific computing and research, the optimization is not a problem for small data sets and lower dimensional problems. The problem arise, when the data is large, stochastic in nature, and/or multidimensional. The basic optimization tools fail for such problems due to the complexity. The genetic algorithms, based on the natural selection hypothesis, play an imperative role to deal with such complex problems. Genetic algorithms are used in the literature to optimize numerous problems. In the field of computational biology, these algorithms have provided cost effective solutions to find optimal values for large data sets. The genetic algorithms have been used for image reconstruction. These algorithms are based on sub-algorithms to improve the accuracy and precision. We will discuss the advanced genetic algorithms and their applications in detail. Genetic algorithm, in hybrid form have attracted interest of researchers from almost all fields, including <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, applied mathematics, engineering and computational biology. These tools help to analyze the systems in a swift manner. This important feature is discussed with the aid of examples. The time series forecasting and the Bayesian inference, in combination with the genetic algorithms, can prove to be powerful artificial intelligence tools. We will discuss this important aspect in detail with the aid of some examples."

                "The study of argumentation is transversal to several research domains, from philosophy to linguistics, from the law to <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and artificial intelligence. In discourse analysis, several distinct models have been proposed to harness argumentation, each with a different focus or aim. To analyze the use of argumentation in natural language, several corpora annotation efforts have been carried out, with a more or less explicit grounding on one of such theoretical argumentation models. In fact, given the recent growing interest in argument mining applications, argument-annotated corpora are crucial to train machine learning models in a supervised way. However, the proliferation of such corpora has led to a wide disparity in the granularity of the argument annotations employed. In this paper, we review the most relevant theoretical argumentation models, after which we survey argument annotation projects closely following those theoretical models. We also highlight the main simplifications that are often introduced in practice. Furthermore, we glimpse other annotation efforts that are not so theoretically grounded but instead follow a shallower approach. It turns out that most argument annotation projects make their own assumptions and simplifications, both in terms of the textual genre they focus on and in terms of adapting the adopted theoretical argumentation model for their own agenda. Issues of compatibility among argument-annotated corpora are discussed by looking at the problem from a syntactical, semantic, and practical perspective. Finally, we discuss current and prospective applications of models that take advantage of argument-annotated corpora."

                "The past decade has seen a number of impressive developments in predictive chemistry and reaction informatics driven by machine learning applications to <em>computer</em>-aided synthesis planning. While many of these developments have been made even with relatively small, bespoke data sets, in order to advance the role of AI in the field at scale, there must be significant improvements in the reporting of reaction data. Currently, the majority of publicly available data is reported in an unstructured format and heavily imbalanced toward high-yielding reactions, which influences the types of models that can be successfully trained. In this Perspective, we analyze several data curation and sharing initiatives that have seen success in chemistry and molecular biology. We discuss several factors that have contributed to their success and how we can take lessons from these case studies and apply them to reaction data. Finally, we spotlight the Open Reaction Database and summarize key actions the community can take toward making reaction data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), including the use of mandates from funding agencies and publishers."

                "In addition to their recognized value for obtaining 3D digital dental models, intraoral scanners (IOSs) have recently been proven to be promising tools for oral health diagnostics. In this work, the most recent literature on IOSs was reviewed with a focus on their applications as detection systems of oral cavity pathologies. Those applications of IOSs falling in the general area of detection systems for oral health diagnostics (e.g., caries, dental wear, periodontal diseases, oral cancer) were included, while excluding those works mainly focused on 3D dental model reconstruction for implantology, orthodontics, or prosthodontics. Three major scientific databases, namely Scopus, PubMed, and Web of <em>Science</em>, were searched and explored by three independent reviewers. The synthesis and analysis of the studies was carried out by considering the type and technical features of the IOS, the study objectives, and the specific diagnostic applications. From the synthesis of the twenty-five included studies, the main diagnostic fields where IOS technology applies were highlighted, ranging from the detection of tooth wear and caries to the diagnosis of plaques, periodontal defects, and other complications. This shows how additional diagnostic information can be obtained by combining the IOS technology with other radiographic techniques. Despite some promising results, the clinical evidence regarding the use of IOSs as oral health probes is still limited, and further efforts are needed to validate the diagnostic potential of IOSs over conventional tools."

                "Not long ago, hearables paved the way for biosensing, fitness, and healthcare monitoring. Smart earbuds today are not only producing sound but also monitoring vital signs. Reliable determination of cardiovascular and pulmonary system information can explore the use of hearables for physiological monitoring. Recent research shows that photoplethysmography (PPG) signals not only contain details on oxygen saturation level (SPO2) but also carry more physiological information including pulse rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, and arterial-related information. The analysis of the PPG signal from the ear has proven to be reliable and accurate in the research setting. (1) Background: The present integrative review explores the existing literature on an in-ear PPG signal and its application. This review aims to identify the current technology and usage of in-ear PPG and existing evidence on in-ear PPG in physiological monitoring. This review also analyzes in-ear (PPG) measurement configuration and principle, waveform characteristics, processing technology, and feature extraction characteristics. (2) Methods: We performed a comprehensive search to discover relevant in-ear PPG articles published until December 2022. The following electronic databases: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of <em>Science</em>, and PubMed were utilized to conduct the studies addressing the evidence of in-ear PPG in physiological monitoring. (3) Results: Fourteen studies were identified but nine studies were finalized. Eight studies were on different principles and configurations of hearable PPG, and eight studies were on processing technology and feature extraction and its evidence in in-ear physiological monitoring. We also highlighted the limitations and challenges of using in-ear PPG in physiological monitoring. (4) Conclusions: The available evidence has revealed the future of in-ear PPG in physiological monitoring. We have also analyzed the potential limitation and challenges that in-ear PPG will face in processing the signal."

                "Psychological flow has been measured in several areas to analyse to what extent users are engaged in particular tasks, and is relevant in the design of products like software, videogames, and eLearning courses. Although there is an unknown number of questionnaires for evaluating different aspects of psychological flow, the research problem faced in this paper is the analysis of the validity of these questionnaires, since it has only been probed for some of them. Thus, our goal is to synthesize the current evidence regarding validated questionnaires in the English language for psychological flow measurement by conducting a systematic review according to the PRISMA framework. As a result, we found a total number of 34 validated questionnaires to assess flow. The number of their items ranged from 3 to 66, while 63 different dimensions of optimal experiences were taken into consideration. Moreover, the contexts of use differed, including methods to assess flow intensity, prevalence, variations, proneness, metacognitions, in crowds, observed, as dimensions of autotelic personalities, or to differentiate flow from clutch states. As a consequence, this paper facilitates the selection of the questionnaires for research or applied aims, far beyond the classic dichotomy of prevalence–proneness. Moreover, we present a reinterpretation of the nine-dimensional scheme of flow in stages, and recommend future research for engineering and <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>."

                "Network <em>science</em> provides a set of tools for the characterization of the structure and functional behavior of complex systems. Yet a major problem is to quantify how the structural domain is related to the dynamical one. In other words, how the diversity of dynamical states of a system can be predicted from the static network structure? Or the reverse problem: starting from a set of signals derived from experimental recordings, how can one discover the network connections or the causal relations behind the observed dynamics? Despite the advances achieved over the last two decades, many challenges remain concerning the study of the structure-dynamics interplay of complex systems. In neuroscience, progress is typically constrained by the low spatio-temporal resolution of experiments and by the lack of a universal inferring framework for empirical systems. To address these issues, applications of network <em>science</em> and artificial intelligence to neural data have been rapidly growing. In this article, we review important recent applications of methods from those fields to the study of the interplay between structure and functional dynamics of human and zebrafish brain. We cover the selection of topological features for the characterization of brain networks, inference of functional connections, dynamical modeling, and close with applications to both the human and zebrafish brain. This review is intended to neuroscientists who want to become acquainted with techniques from network <em>science</em>, as well as to researchers from the latter field who are interested in exploring novel application scenarios in neuroscience."

                "Machine and deep learning are used worldwide. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are playing an increasingly important role in the healthcare sector, particularly when combined with big data analytics. Some of the ways that ML and DL are being used in healthcare include Predictive Analytics, Medical Image Analysis, Drug Discovery, Personalized Medicine, and Electronic Health Records (EHR) Analysis. It has become one of the advanced and popular tool for <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> domain.’ The advancement of ML and DL for various fields has opened new avenues for research and development. It could revolutionize prediction and decision-making capabilities. Due to increased awareness about the ML and DL in the healthcare, it has become one of the vital approaches for the sector. High-volume of unstructured, and complex medical imaging data from health monitoring devices, gadgets, sensors, etc. Is the biggest trouble for healthcare sector. The current study uses analysis to examine research trends in adoption of machine learning and deep learning approaches in the healthcare sector. The WoS database for SCI/SCI-E/ESCI journals are used as the datasets for the comprehensive analysis. Apart from these various search strategy are utilised for the requisite scientific analysis of the extracted research documents. Bibliometrics R statistical analysis is performed for year-wise, nation-wise, affiliation-wise, research area, sources, documents, and author based analysis. VOS viewer software is used to create author, source, country, institution, global cooperation, citation, co-citation, and trending term co-occurrence networks. ML and DL, combined with big data analytics, have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving patient outcomes, reducing costs, and accelerating the development of new treatments, so the current study will help academics, researchers, decision-makers, and healthcare professionals understand and direct research."

                "Context: Tertiary education institutions aim to prepare their <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and software engineering students for working life. While much of the technical principles are covered in lower-level courses, team-based capstone courses are a common way to provide students with hands-on experience and teach soft skills. Objective: This paper explores the characteristics of project-based software engineering capstone courses presented in the literature. The goal of this work is to understand the pros and cons of different approaches by synthesising the various aspects of software engineering capstone courses and related experiences. Method: In a systematic literature review for 2007–2022, we identified 127 articles describing real-world capstone courses. These articles were analysed based on their presented course characteristics and the reported course outcomes. Results: The characteristics were synthesised into a taxonomy consisting of duration, team sizes, client and project sources, project implementation, and student assessment. We found out that capstone courses generally last one semester and divide students into groups of 4–5 where they work on a project for a client. For a slight majority of courses, the clients are external to the course staff and students are often expected to produce a proof-of-concept level software product as the main end deliverable. The courses generally include various forms of student assessment both during and at the end of the course. Conclusions: This paper provides researchers and educators with a classification of characteristics of software engineering capstone courses based on previous research. We also further synthesise insights on the reported course outcomes. Our review study aims to help educators to identify various ways of organising capstones and effectively plan and deliver their own capstone courses. The characterisation also helps researchers to conduct further studies on software engineering capstones."

                "The Internet of things (IoT) is a fast evolving technology that enables the development of smart services in numerous domains, such as transportation, health care, and smart cities. Such plethora of IoT devices is expected to be impact sixth-generation (6G) networks. Securing 6G/massive IoT networks against threats, especially novel attacks, is a major challenge for 6G infrastructure to accommodate. Thus, new innovative architectures and paradigms empowered by intelligence, softwarization, and infrastructure virtualization are urgently needed. This manifestation depends upon the power of artificial intelligence integrated with key networking enablers such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) etc. to provide components of promising solutions and innovative approaches for securing the IoT. Researchers across the spectrum in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and engineering are striving to employ machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to improve the detection of cyber threats so that they can classify, predict, and mitigate anomalies and abnormal traffic behaviors. The challenge to design an intrusion detection system (IDS) is how to come up with a scalable solution within a realistic infrastructure architecture aimed at dealing with massive IoT applications. There is a multiplicity of factors to consider toward an optimal intelligent solution, however, we can perceive that future solutions should be tailored on native virtualized infrastructure. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive study on massive IoT security aspects toward 6G networks, especially IDS systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that combines the integration of ML/DL and key networking technology enablers that support future 6G infrastructure for massive IoT security, with the aim to outline research challenges, relevant issues, and future directions."

                "According to the socio-constructivist theories of learning, collaborative learning allows negotiation of shared meanings and co-construction of new knowledge among peers. This approach fits particularly well with healthcare professional education needs, as these professionals often face challenging issues that require the ability to fully understand the complexity of the patients’ health conditions through working with others. However, while collaborative learning approaches are widely used in face-to-face nurse education contexts, their online equivalent still seem to be understudied, in spite of their great potential for the field. This systematic literature review investigates: (1) to what extent are online collaborative learning activities being adopted and investigated in formal nurse education, (2) What kind of online collaborative learning activities/techniques are proposed and what team structures are employed, (3) what technologies are used to run these learning activities, and (4) what methods are used to evaluate the impact of these activities. Studies were included if they presented online collaborative learning activities proposed by Universities or VET (Vocational Education and Training) providers. Articles published in 2015 or later were collected in November 2022 from Scopus, Web of <em>Science</em> and Medline. A total of 1059 records were retrieved, selected and analysed by four coders, resulting in a final dataset of 75 papers that were coded for type of collaborative approach, study characteristics, research methodology used, strength of evidence, and relevance to the research questions. Most of them described the use of activities like Discussions, Case Studies and Peer Reviews, sometimes in association with Role Play. In terms of technologies, Learning Managements Systems, forums and social media were already common pre-pandemic, but during the lockdown synchronous communication tools – often used to support simulations – took over. Data collection was carried out quantitatively, qualitatively or using mixed methods, but in many cases data reporting is weak or absent at all. The majority of the retrieved papers illustrate activities where collaboration was not structured in any way and there was no joint assignment or common objective/artefact that learners needed to reach/produce. In case of blended interventions, often collaboration is limited to the face-to-face sessions, while the digital setting is used for individual work. In terms of social structure, most of the time small groups or plenaries are used. In summary, the review reveals that studies on online collaborative learning for nurses are limited, especially in Europe, and the design of online collaborative activities often clashes with the principles put forward by the <em>Computer</em> Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) research community. Based on the results of the review we put forth some key recommendations, such as ensuring that online collaboration involves the creation of a shared artefact and striving to make virtual simulations actually collaborative, rather than limited to envisage student interactions in the debriefing phase. The paper also proposes a number of research areas seldom investigated and that would deserve further attention in the future."

                "The Fourth Industrial Revolution, also named Industry 4.0, is leveraging several modern computing fields. Industry 4.0 comprises automated tasks in manufacturing facilities, which generate massive quantities of data through sensors. These data contribute to the interpretation of industrial operations in favor of managerial and technical decision-making. Data <em>science</em> supports this interpretation due to extensive technological artifacts, particularly data processing methods and software tools. In this regard, the present article proposes a systematic literature review of these methods and tools employed in distinct industrial segments, considering an investigation of different time series levels and data quality. The systematic methodology initially approached the filtering of 10,456 articles from five academic databases, 103 being selected for the corpus. Thereby, the study answered three general, two focused, and two statistical research questions to shape the findings. As a result, this research found 16 industrial segments, 168 data <em>science</em> methods, and 95 software tools explored by studies from the literature. Furthermore, the research highlighted the employment of diverse neural network subvariations and missing details in the data composition.

                "In recent years, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have become one of the leading causes of mortality globally. At early stages, CVDs appear with minor symptoms and progressively get worse. The majority of people experience symptoms such as exhaustion, shortness of breath, ankle swelling, fluid retention, and other symptoms when starting CVD. Coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart defect (CHD), mitral regurgitation, and angina are the most common CVDs. Clinical methods such as blood tests, electrocardiography (ECG) signals, and medical imaging are the most effective methods used for the detection of CVDs. Among the diagnostic methods, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) is increasingly used to diagnose, monitor the disease, plan treatment and predict CVDs. Coupled with all the advantages of CMR data, CVDs diagnosis is challenging for physicians as each scan has many slices of data, and the contrast of it might be low. To address these issues, deep learning (DL) techniques have been employed in the diagnosis of CVDs using CMR data, and much research is currently being conducted in this field. This review provides an overview of the studies performed in CVDs detection using CMR images and DL techniques. The introduction section examined CVDs types, diagnostic methods, and the most important medical imaging techniques. The following presents research to detect CVDs using CMR images and the most significant DL methods. Another section discussed the challenges in diagnosing CVDs from CMRI data. Next, the discussion section discusses the results of this review, and future work in CVDs diagnosis from CMR images and DL techniques are outlined. Finally, the most important findings of this study are presented in the conclusion section."

                "Background: Augmented reality (AR) is a new human-<em>computer</em> interaction technology that combines virtual reality, <em>computer</em> vision, and <em>computer</em> networks. With the rapid advancement of the medical field towards intelligence and data visualisation, AR systems are becoming increasingly popular in the medical field because they can provide doctors with clear enough medical images and accurate image navigation in practical applications. However, it has been discovered that different display types of AR systems have different effects on doctors' perception of the image after virtual-real fusion during the actual medical application. If doctors cannot correctly perceive the image, they may be unable to correctly match the virtual information with the real world, which will have a significant impact on their ability to recognise complex structures. Methods: This paper uses Citespace, a literature analysis tool, to visualise and analyse the research hotspots when AR systems are used in the medical field. Results: A visual analysis of the 1163 articles retrieved from the Web of <em>Science</em> Core Collection database reveals that display technology and visualisation technology are the key research directions of AR systems at the moment. Conclusion: This paper categorises AR systems based on their display principles, reviews current image perception optimisation schemes for various types of systems, and analyses and compares different display types of AR systems based on their practical applications in the field of smart medical care so that doctors can select the appropriate display types based on different application scenarios. Finally, the future development direction of AR display technology is anticipated in order for AR technology to be more effectively applied in the field of smart medical care. The advancement of display technology for AR systems is critical for their use in the medical field, and the advantages and disadvantages of various display types should be considered in different application scenarios to select the best AR system."

                "Criminalistics is another name for forensic <em>science</em>. It uses <em>science</em> in a criminal investigation as governed by judicial criteria of acceptable, relevant, and admissible evidence and criminal procedure. Forensic <em>science</em> has been around for a long time and has seen considerable changes, from fingerprint identification to DNA analysis and digital forensics. The study focuses on the most critical technologies in forensic <em>science</em>, then deconstructs numerous <em>computer</em> vision, image processing, and fuzzy logic methodologies in the large subject of forensic research. It also addresses the prospects for using the technology in approaches ranging from biometric identification to a 3D reconstruction of a crime scene. To some extent, adopting the numerous methodologies outlined in the paper helps overcome the disadvantages and challenges of traditional forensics procedures. Furthermore, some constraints are taken into account. For example, in various ways, the primary evidence is pre-processed and translated to an intermediate or more lucid form before the crux algorithms are applied. As a result, there is still plenty of room for research in this subject, such as developing solid algorithms, making the technology accept raw data, etc. If utilized correctly, forensic <em>science</em> technology has the potential to affect a paradigm shift in the criminal justice system."

                "Light field displays offer glasses-free 3D visualization, which means that multiple individuals may observe the same content simultaneously from a virtually infinite number of perspectives without the need of viewing devices. The practical utilization of such visualization systems include various passive and active use cases. In the case of the latter, users often engage with the utilized system via human–<em>computer</em> interaction. Beyond conventional controls and interfaces, it is also possible to use advanced solutions such as motion tracking, which may seem seamless and highly convenient when paired with glasses-free 3D visualization. However, such solutions may not necessarily outperform conventional controls, and their true potentials may fundamentally depend on the use case in which they are deployed. In this paper, we provide a review on the 3D interaction of light field displays. Our work takes into consideration the different requirements posed by passive and active use cases, discusses the numerous challenges, limitations and potentials, and proposes research initiatives that could progress the investigated field of <em>science</em>."

                "Network analytics provides a scientific solution to interact with networks through effective management of network data and corresponding visualization. Network analytics has been considered essential in many research areas as well as in commercial applications, including use cases in bioinformatics, biomedicine, security, social <em>science</em>, and knowledge graph exploration. We see that networks and the associated analysis process are expected to be initially supported by graph databases with advanced query engines, and later the filtered contents are rendered using corresponding visualization approaches for better communication and knowledge exchange. For this special issue (SI), we recruited papers describing research based on graph database utilization and network visualization that potentially could be integrated as a full pipeline, as well as their synergy for various applied problems. Through the formal IEEE <em>Computer</em> Graphics and Applications review process of the four submissions, we accepted three papers for this SI, focusing on the novelty and potential integration within the network analytics pipeline. These selected papers demonstrate the wide potentiality of techniques for complex network analytics."

                "Growth prediction technology is not only a practical application but also a crucial approach that strengthens the safety of image processing techniques. By supplementing the growth images obtained from the original images, especially in insufficient data sets, we can increase the robustness of machine learning. Therefore, predicting the growth of living organisms is an important technology that increases the safety of existing applications that target living organisms and can extend to areas not yet realized. This paper is a systematic literature review (SLR) investigating biological growth prediction based on the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. We systematically survey existing studies from 2017 to 2022 to provide other researchers with current trends. We searched four digital libraries—IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, <em>Science</em> Direct, and Web of <em>Science</em>—and finally analyzed 47 articles. We summarize the methods used, year, features, accuracy, and dataset of each paper. In particular, we explained LSTM, GAN, and STN, the most frequently used methods among the 20 papers related to machine learning (40% of all papers)."

                "Health is gold, and good health is a matter of survival for humanity. The development of the healthcare industry aligns with the development of humans throughout history. Nowadays, along with the strong growth of <em>science</em> and technology, the medical domain in general and the healthcare industry have achieved many breakthroughs, such as remote medical examination and treatment applications, pandemic prediction, and remote patient health monitoring. The advent of 5th generation communication networks in the early 2020s led to the Internet of Things concept. Moreover, the 6th generation communication networks (so-called 6G) expected to launch in 2030 will be the next revolution of the IoT era, and will include autonomous IoT systems and form a series of endogenous intelligent applications that serve humanity. One of the domains that receives the most attention is smart healthcare. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive survey of IoT-based technologies and solutions in the medical field. Then, we propose an all-in-one computing architecture for real-time IoHT applications and present possible solutions to achieving the proposed architecture. Finally, we discuss challenges, open issues, and future research directions. We hope that the results of this study will serve as essential guidelines for further research in the human healthcare domain."

                "Inspired by state-of-the-art material <em>science</em>, <em>computer</em> techniques, artificial intelligence, and automatic control, new-generation transportation infrastructures are becoming digitalized and intelligent. Many major developed countries around the globe are actively promoting the application of innovative intelligence-based technologies in transportation infrastructures in accordance with local conditions. This review begins with a brief discussion on the basic definition, scientific foundation, and development process for the intellectualization of transportation infrastructures. Then, following the whole life-cycle chain of design, construction, operational maintenance, and elimination, the current research status and major challenges presented by intellectualization technologies are systematically investigated. Subsequently, recent achievements in intellectual technologies are comprehensively presented by selecting the Beijing–Zhangjiakou High-Speed Railway—the world's first railway built based on the concept of intelligent construction—as an example. Finally, a discussion on the future development of the intellectualization of transportation infrastructures is provided from the three dimensions of standard systems, theoretical methods, and talent training."

                "Objective: Many <em>Computer</em> Aided Prognostic (CAP) systems based on machine learning techniques have been proposed in the field of oncology. The objective of this systematic review was to assess and critically appraise the methodologies and approaches used in predicting the prognosis of gynecological cancers using CAPs. Methods: Electronic databases were used to systematically search for studies utilizing machine learning methods in gynecological cancers. Study risk of bias (ROB) and applicability were assessed using the PROBAST tool. 139 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 71 predicted outcomes for ovarian cancer patients, 41 predicted outcomes for cervical cancer patients, 28 predicted outcomes for uterine cancer patients, and 2 predicted outcomes for gynecological malignancies broadly. Results: Random forest (22.30 %) and support vector machine (21.58 %) classifiers were used most commonly. Use of clinicopathological, genomic and radiomic data as predictors was observed in 48.20 %, 51.08 % and 17.27 % of studies, respectively, with some studies using multiple modalities. 21.58 % of studies were externally validated. Twenty-three individual studies compared ML and non-ML methods. Study quality was highly variable and methodologies, statistical reporting and outcome measures were inconsistent, preventing generalized commentary or meta-analysis of performance outcomes. Conclusion: There is significant variability in model development when prognosticating gynecological malignancies with respect to variable selection, machine learning (ML) methods and endpoint selection. This heterogeneity prevents meta-analysis and conclusions regarding the superiority of ML methods. Furthermore, PROBAST-mediated ROB and applicability analysis demonstrates concern for the translatability of existing models. This review identifies ways that this can be improved upon in future works to develop robust, clinically translatable models within this promising field."

                "Purpose: The purpose of this review paper is to address the substantial challenges of the outdated exoskeletons used for rehabilitation and further study the current advancements in this field. The shortcomings and technological developments in sensing the input signals to enable the desired motions, actuation, control and training methods are explained for further improvements in exoskeleton research. Design/methodology/approach: Search platforms such as Web of <em>Science</em>, IEEE, Scopus and PubMed were used to collect the literature. The total number of recent articles referred to in this review paper with relevant keywords is filtered to 143. Findings: Exoskeletons are getting smarter often with the integration of various modern tools to enhance the effectiveness of rehabilitation. The recent applications of bio signal sensing for rehabilitation to perform user-desired actions promote the development of independent exoskeleton systems. The modern concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning enable the implementation of brain–<em>computer</em> interfacing (BCI) and hybrid BCIs in exoskeletons. Likewise, novel actuation techniques are necessary to overcome the significant challenges seen in conventional exoskeletons, such as the high-power requirements, poor back drivability, bulkiness and low energy efficiency. Implementation of suitable controller algorithms facilitates the instantaneous correction of actuation signals for all joints to obtain the desired motion. Furthermore, applying the traditional rehabilitation training methods is monotonous and exhausting for the user and the trainer. The incorporation of games, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in exoskeletons has made rehabilitation training far more effective in recent times. The combination of electroencephalogram and electromyography-based hybrid BCI is desirable for signal sensing and controlling the exoskeletons based on user intentions. The challenges faced with actuation can be resolved by developing advanced power sources with minimal size and weight, easy portability, lower cost and good energy storage capacity. Implementation of novel smart materials enables a colossal scope for actuation in future exoskeleton developments. Improved versions of sliding mode control reported in the literature are suitable for robust control of nonlinear exoskeleton models. Optimizing the controller parameters with the help of evolutionary algorithms is also an effective method for exoskeleton control. The experiments using VR/AR and games for rehabilitation training yielded promising results as the performance of patients improved substantially. Research limitations/implications: Robotic exoskeleton-based rehabilitation will help to reduce the fatigue of physiotherapists. Repeated and intention-based exercise will improve the recovery of the affected part at a faster pace. Improved rehabilitation training methods like VR/AR-based technologies help in motivating the subject. Originality/value: The paper describes the recent methods for signal sensing, actuation, control and rehabilitation training approaches used in developing exoskeletons. All these areas are key elements in an exoskeleton where the review papers are published very limitedly. Therefore, this paper will stand as a guide for the researchers working in this domain."

                "It is for the first time that quantum simulation for high-energy physics (HEP) is studied in the U.S. decadal particle-physics community planning, and in fact until recently, this was not considered a mainstream topic in the community. This fact speaks of a remarkable rate of growth of this subfield over the past few years, stimulated by the impressive advancements in quantum information <em>sciences</em> (QIS) and associated technologies over the past decade, and the significant investment in this area by the government and private sectors in the U.S. and other countries. High-energy physicists have quickly identified problems of importance to our understanding of nature at the most fundamental level, from tiniest distances to cosmological extents, that are intractable with classical <em>computers</em> but may benefit from quantum advantage. They have initiated, and continue to carry out, a vigorous program in theory, algorithm, and hardware co-design for simulations of relevance to the HEP mission. This Roadmap is an attempt to bring this exciting and yet challenging area of research to the spotlight, and to elaborate on what the promises, requirements, challenges, and potential solutions are over the next decade and beyond."

                "Affective disorders can greatly influence the everyday lives of neurotypical and autistic individuals. As platforms that promote engagement, <em>computer</em>-based serious games (CSGs) have been previously proposed as therapies to treat affective disorders for both populations. However, these CSGs were assessed on a wide variety of experimental conditions, and there is a lack of comparative studies on their effectiveness. In this study, we identified and analyzed 37 interventions of CSGs for affective disorders in autistic and neurotypical individuals from 507 initial search results from four databases (Embase, Scopus, Web Of <em>Science</em> and IEEE Xplore), using concepts such as ‘serious-games’, ‘affective-disorders’, ‘autism’ and ‘neurotypical’. A total of 21 different CSGs were identified that were evaluated with 30 different outcome measures in the reviewed interventions. A positive impact was reported in 22 of them; specifically, all instances of depression interventions reported a positive impact of CSG therapies. Our comparative analysis indicates that CSG applications could be effective in treating affective disorders in autistic and neurotypical individuals. Additionally, our analysis identifies CSG design characteristics that might be useful in applications involving depression, anxiety and phobias. Based on these characteristics, we provide a set of recommendations for CSG interventions for affective disorder therapies."

                "Automatic image description, also known as image captioning, aims to describe the elements included in an image and their relationships. This task involves two research fields: <em>computer</em> vision and natural language processing; thus, it has received much attention in <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>. In this review paper, we follow the Kitchenham review methodology to present the most relevant approaches to image description methodologies based on deep learning. We focused on works using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract the characteristics of images and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for automatic sentence generation. As a result, 53 research articles using the encoder-decoder approach were selected, focusing only on supervised learning. The main contributions of this systematic review are: (i) to describe the most relevant image description papers implementing an encoder-decoder approach from 2014 to 2022 and (ii) to determine the main architectures, datasets, and metrics that have been applied to image description."

                "Despite the growing interest in possible applications of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em> and artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of neurocritical care (neuro-ICU), widespread clinical applications are still missing. In neuro-ICU, the collection and analysis in real time of large datasets can play a crucial role in advancing this medical field and improving personalized patient care. For example, AI algorithms can detect subtle changes in brain activity or vital signs, alerting clinicians to potentially life-threatening conditions and facilitating rapid intervention. Consequently, data-driven AI and predictive analytics can greatly enhance medical decision making, diagnosis, and treatment, ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients. Nevertheless, there is a significant disparity between the current capabilities of AI systems and the potential benefits and applications that could be achieved with more advanced AI technologies. This gap is usually indicated as the AI chasm. In this paper, the underlying causes of the AI chasm in neuro-ICU are analyzed, along with proposed recommendations for utilizing AI to attain a competitive edge, foster innovation, and enhance patient outcomes. To bridge the AI divide in neurocritical care, it is crucial to foster collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, with a focus on specific use cases. Additionally, strategic investments in AI technology, education and training, and infrastructure are needed to unlock the potential of AI technology. Before implementing a technology in patient care, it is essential to conduct thorough studies and establish clinical validation in real-world environments to ensure its effectiveness and safety. Finally, the development of ethical and regulatory frameworks is mandatory to ensure the secure and efficient deployment of AI technology throughout the process."

                "Plant phenotyping studies the complex characteristics of plants, with the aim of evaluating and assessing their condition and finding better exemplars. Recently, a new branch emerged in the phenotyping field, namely, high-throughput phenotyping (HTP). Specifically, HTP exploits modern data sampling techniques to gather a high amount of data that can be used to improve the effectiveness of phenotyping. Hence, HTP combines the knowledge derived from the phenotyping domain with <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, engineering, and data analysis techniques. In this scenario, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been successfully integrated with noninvasive imaging techniques, playing a key role in automation, standardization, and quantitative data analysis. This study aims to systematically review two main areas of interest for HTP: hardware and software. For each of these areas, two influential factors were identified: for hardware, platforms and sensing equipment were analyzed; for software, the focus was on algorithms and new trends. The study was conducted following the PRISMA protocol, which allowed the refinement of the research on a wide selection of papers by extracting a meaningful dataset of 32 articles of interest. The analysis highlighted the diffusion of ground platforms, which were used in about 47% of reviewed methods, and RGB sensors, mainly due to their competitive costs, high compatibility, and versatility. Furthermore, DL-based algorithms accounted for the larger share (about 69%) of reviewed approaches, mainly due to their effectiveness and the focus posed by the scientific community over the last few years. Future research will focus on improving DL models to better handle hardware-generated data. The final aim is to create integrated, user-friendly, and scalable tools that can be directly deployed and used on the field to improve the overall crop yield."

                "Molecular modeling techniques have become indispensable in many fields of molecular <em>sciences</em> in which the details related to mechanisms and reactivity need to be studied at an atomistic level. This review article provides a collection of computational modeling works on a topic of enormous interest and urgent relevance: the properties of metalloenzymes involved in the degradation and valorization of natural biopolymers and synthetic plastics on the basis of both circular biofuel production and bioremediation strategies. In particular, we will focus on lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase, laccases, and various heme peroxidases involved in the processing of polysaccharides, lignins, rubbers, and some synthetic polymers. Special attention will be dedicated to the interaction between these enzymes and their substrate studied at different levels of theory, starting from classical molecular docking and molecular dynamics techniques up to techniques based on quantum chemistry."

                "Augmented reality (AR) overlays virtual elements on real-time images. Because to its ubiquitous use on desktop <em>computers</em> and handheld devices, it has become a major study topic. AR provides benefits like engagement, motivation, and learning result, but drawbacks like the technology tool and application and pedagogical challenges. After 2015, global Google searches for AR increased. This study analyzed “AR” literature released after 2015. Exclusion and inclusion criteria are studies were divided into social <em>sciences</em> and education and published in English. Research should be published during 2015-2022. 3,823 studies were analyzed. AR publications will increase after 2020. Annual citations averaged 2.49. <em>Computer</em> & Education leads the top ten journals in citations. National Taiwan Normal University and Beijing Normal University have the most publications when ordered by writers’ institutions. China leads global publications, whereas the US leads overall publications. China led in citations, followed by the US. Macedonia led the average number of article citations, followed by Israel. The strategic map shows the center and density of key issues. “Student learning,” “AR applications,” and “AR technology” are linked and vital terms. Based on the results of the bibliometric study, researchers who wish to work on AR may emphasize theme-based learning studies and AR. Researchers that are considering conducting bibliometric analysis on AR are urged to conduct research utilizing many databases."

                "Background: Drug discovery processes, such as new drug development, drug synergy, and drug repurposing, consume significant yearly resources. <em>Computer</em>-aided drug discovery can effectively improve the efficiency of drug discovery. Traditional <em>computer</em> methods such as virtual screening and molecular docking have achieved many gratifying results in drug development. However, with the rapid growth of <em>computer</em> <em>science</em>, data structures have changed considerably; with more extensive and dimensional data and more significant amounts of data, traditional <em>computer</em> methods can no longer be applied well. Deep learning methods are based on deep neural network structures that can handle high-dimensional data very well, so they are used in current drug development. Results: This review summarized the applications of deep learning methods in drug discovery, such as drug target discovery, drug de novo design, drug recommendation, drug synergy, and drug response prediction. While applying deep learning methods to drug discovery suffers from a lack of data, transfer learning is an excellent solution to this problem. Furthermore, deep learning methods can extract deeper features and have higher predictive power than other machine learning methods. Deep learning methods have great potential in drug discovery and are expected to facilitate drug discovery development. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]."

                "Background: Providing adaptive scaffolds to help learners develop effective self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviours has been an important goal for intelligent learning environments. Adaptive scaffolding is especially important in open-ended learning environments (OELE), where novice learners often face difficulties in completing their learning tasks. Objectives: This paper presents a systematic framework for adaptive scaffolding in Betty's Brain, a learning-by-teaching OELE for middle school <em>science</em>, where students construct a causal model to teach a virtual agent, generically named Betty. We evaluate the adaptive scaffolding framework and discuss its implications on the development of more effective scaffolds for SRL in OELEs. Methods: We detect key cognitive/metacognitive inflection points, that is, moments where students' behaviours and performance change during learning, often suggesting an inability to apply effective learning strategies. At inflection points, Mr. Davis (a mentor agent in Betty's Brain) or Betty (the teachable agent) provides context-specific conversational feedback, focusing on strategies to help the student become a more productive learner, or encouragement to support positive emotions. We conduct a classroom study with 98 middle schoolers to analyse the impact of adaptive scaffolds on students' learning behaviours and performance. We analyse how students with differential pre-to-post learning outcomes receive and use the scaffolds to support their subsequent learning process in Betty's Brain. Results and Conclusions: Adaptive scaffolding produced mixed results, with some scaffolds (viz., strategic hints that supported debugging and assessment of causal models) being generally more useful to students than others (viz., encouragement prompts). Additionally, there were differences in how students with high versus low learning outcomes responded to some hints, as suggested by the differences in their learning behaviours and performance in the intervals after scaffolding. Overall, our findings suggest how adaptive scaffolding in OELEs like Betty's Brain can be further improved to better support SRL behaviours and narrow the learning outcomes gap between high and low performing students. Implications: This paper contributes to our understanding and impact of adaptive scaffolding in OELEs. The results of our study indicate that successful scaffolding has to combine context-sensitive inflection points with conversational feedback that is tailored to the students' current proficiency levels and needs. Also, our conceptual framework can be used to design adaptive scaffolds that help students develop and apply SRL behaviours in other <em>computer</em>-based learning environments."

                "Most real-world problems involve some type of optimization problems that are often constrained. Numerous researchers have investigated several techniques to deal with constrained single-objective and multi-objective evolutionary optimization in many fields, including theory and application. This presented study provides a novel analysis of scholarly literature on constraint-handling techniques for single-objective and multi-objective population-based algorithms according to the most relevant journals and articles. As a contribution to this study, the paper reviews the main ideas of the most state-of-the-art constraint handling techniques in population-based optimization, and then the study addresses the bibliometric analysis, with a focus on multi-objective, in the field. The extracted papers include research articles, reviews, book/book chapters, and conference papers published between 2000 and 2021 for analysis. The results indicate that the constraint-handling techniques for multi-objective optimization have received much less attention compared with single-objective optimization. The most promising algorithms for such optimization were determined to be genetic algorithms, differential evolutionary algorithms, and particle swarm intelligence. Additionally, “Engineering,” “<em>Computer</em> <em>Science</em>,” and “ Mathematics” were identified as the top three research fields in which future research work is anticipated to increase."
